This variation in incubation periods is thought to be an adaptation to different ecological and evolutionary pressures.\n\nOne explanation for the variation in incubation periods is that it allows birds to time the hatching of their young to coincide with the availability of food resources. For example, species that breed in areas with abundant food resources may have shorter incubation periods, allowing their young to hatch and begin foraging sooner. In contrast, species that breed in areas with limited food resources may have longer incubation periods, allowing their young to develop further before hatching and increasing their chances of survival."], ["What are the authors' names of the second reference text?", "The authors' names of the second reference text are:\n\nRicklefs RE, Austin SH, Robinson WD. #78. #78.
