 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 10 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 25, 2023 Mr. Tiffany  (for himself,  Mr. Perry ,  Mr. Donalds ,  Mrs. Steel ,  Mr. Norman ,  Mr. Ogles ,  Mr. LaMalfa ,  Mr. Owens ,  Mr. Good of Virginia ,  Mr. Weber of Texas ,  Mr. LaTurner ,  Ms. Malliotakis ,  Mr. DesJarlais ,  Mr. Gooden of Texas ,  Mr. Carter of Georgia ,  Ms. Mace ,  Mrs. McClain ,  Mr. Crenshaw , and  Mr. McClintock ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Foreign Affairs , and in addition to the Committee on  Ways and Means , for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Expressing the sense of Congress that the United States should resume normal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, negotiate a bilateral free trade agreement with Taiwan, and support Taiwan’s membership in international organizations. 
 Whereas the people of Taiwan have established a free, open, pluralistic, and democratic society;   Whereas the people of Taiwan have conducted 7 democratic Presidential elections yielding 3 peaceful transfers of power, successive parliamentary elections, multiple nationwide referenda, and numerous local elections; 
 Whereas Taiwan and its outlying islands have never been under the jurisdiction or control of the Communist regime in Beijing, which continues to illegitimately claim sovereignty over Taiwan and its people;   Whereas Communist China has weaponized the so-called  One China Policy  to block Taiwan’s membership and full participation in international organizations and events ranging from the United Nations and the World Health Organization to the Olympic Games; 
 Whereas the so-called  One China Policy  is obsolete, does not serve the people of Taiwan or the United States, and fails to reflect the obvious reality that Taiwan has been a sovereign and independent country for over 70 years;   Whereas Taiwan maintains diplomatic, cultural, and economic links with several countries around the world, demonstrating its clear and indisputable independence from the People’s Republic of China; 
 Whereas Taiwan and the United States maintained normal diplomatic relations and a Mutual Defense Treaty until President Carter abruptly abandoned both without the approval of Congress in 1979;   Whereas Congress responded by adopting the landmark, bipartisan Taiwan Relations Act, codifying in law the basis for continued friendly relations between the people of the United States and Taiwan; 
 Whereas former President Reagan strengthened ties with Taiwan by issuing the  Six Assurances , noting that  The United States has not altered its position regarding sovereignty over Taiwan , underscoring that Communist Chinese claims of sovereignty over Taiwan have never been accepted by the United States;   Whereas former President Clinton declared  that the issues between Beijing and Taiwan must be resolved peacefully and with the assent of the people of Taiwan ; 
 Whereas President Trump approved the sale of defense articles to Taiwan and signed bipartisan legislation allowing for expanded high-level exchanges and cooperation between Taiwanese and American officials; and   Whereas Taiwan remains a steadfast ally of the United States and a responsible and conscientious member of the international community: Now, therefore, be it 
 That—   (1) the United States commends the people of Taiwan for their commitment to democracy, civil liberties, and human rights; and 
 (2) it is the sense of Congress that—   (A) the President should abandon the antiquated  One China Policy  in favor of a policy that recognizes the objective reality that Taiwan is an independent country not governed by or included within the territory of the People’s Republic of China; 
 (B) the President should recognize the legitimacy of the democratically elected National Government in Taipei, normalize diplomatic relations between our two nations, appoint a United States ambassador to Taiwan, and receive a Taiwanese ambassador to the United States;   (C) the President should rescind arbitrary agency guidelines that restrict normal communication and interaction between United States and Taiwanese officials; 
 (D) the United States Trade Representative should initiate formal negotiations with Taiwan on the establishment of a United States-Taiwan Free Trade Agreement; and   (E) the President, the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations, and other relevant United States officials should take steps to advocate for Taiwan’s full membership in the United Nations and other international organizations in which the United States is a member."

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 12 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES February 1, 2023 Mrs. Cammack  (for herself,  Mr. Kildee ,  Ms. Letlow ,  Mr. C. Scott Franklin of Florida , and  Mr. Higgins of Louisiana ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Ways and Means , and in addition to the Committee on  Agriculture , for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Expressing the sense of Congress that all direct and indirect subsidies that benefit the production or export of sugar by all major sugar-producing and -consuming countries should be eliminated. 
 Whereas most major sugar-producing and sugar-consuming countries in the world maintain some form of direct or indirect subsidy to support its sugar growers, processors, or consumers;   Whereas virtually all of the more than 100 countries that produce sugar maintain market-distorting subsidy programs, including— 
 (1) the Government of Brazil which provides direct and indirect subsidies of at least $2,500,000,000 per year for programs to promote its sugar industry and has increased subsidies in recent years, including preferential loans and debt forgiveness;   (2) the Government of India which provided nearly $14,000,000,000 per year in subsidy supports as recently as 2018 to prop up its inefficient sugar industry, including the provision of export subsidies in 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019, and 2020 in potential violation of World Trade Organization obligations; 
 (3) the Government of Thailand which more than tripled its sugar exports after 2004 by providing at least $1,300,000,000 in annual subsidies and government programs to its sugar industry and by maintaining domestic prices well above export prices;   (4) the Governments of the European Union member states which have provided support with an estimated value of $685,000,000 per year to their sugar farmers; 
 (5) the Government of Russia which transformed its country from one of the world’s largest net importers of sugar to a net exporter on the basis of government support estimated at an estimated value of $392,000,000 per year from 2010 to 2017; and    (6) the Government of Mexico which has generously supported its sugarcane growers, and was found guilty in 2014 of injuring United States sugar producers by dumping subsidized sugar into the United States market; 
 Whereas the world sugar market is the most volatile commodity market in the world;   Whereas many countries routinely dump surplus sugar on the world sugar market, at prices below domestic price levels and costs of production; 
 Whereas the foregoing clauses provide ample evidence there is no undistorted, free market in sugar in the world today; and   Whereas, if such a free market did exist, United States sugar farmers and processors could compete effectively in that market: Now, therefore, be it 
 That it is the sense of Congress that—   (1) the President should seek elimination of all direct and indirect subsidies benefiting the production or export of sugar by the government of— 
 (A) each country that exported more than 200,000 metric tons of sugar in 2018, 2019, or 2020; and   (B) by any other country with which the United States has in effect a free trade agreement; 
 (2) if the President determines that all such subsidies by all such countries have been eliminated, the President should submit a report to Congress providing detailed information about how each of the countries has eliminated such subsidies; and   (3) after submitting such a report, the President should propose to Congress legislation to implement United States sugar policy reforms."

 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
 Supporting the Local Radio Freedom Act. 
 
 
 Whereas the United States enjoys broadcasting and sound recording industries that are the envy of the world, due to the symbiotic relationship that has existed among these industries for many decades;     Whereas, for nearly a century, Congress has rejected repeated calls by the recording industry to impose a performance fee on local radio stations for simply playing music on the radio and upsetting the mutually beneficial relationship between local radio and the recording industry;   
 Whereas local radio stations provide free publicity and promotion to the recording industry and performers of music in the form of radio air play, interviews with performers, introduction of new performers, concert promotions, and publicity that promotes the sale of music, concert tickets, ring tones, music videos and associated merchandise;     Whereas Congress found that  the sale of many sound recordings and the careers of many performers benefited considerably from airplay and other promotional activities provided by both noncommercial and advertiser-supported, free over-the-air broadcasting ;   
 Whereas local radio broadcasters provide tens of thousands of hours of essential local news and weather information during times of national emergencies and natural disasters, as well as public affairs programming, sports, and hundreds of millions of dollars of time for public service announcements and local fundraising efforts for worthy charitable causes, all of which are jeopardized if local radio stations are forced to divert revenues to pay for a new performance fee;     Whereas there are many thousands of local radio stations that will suffer severe economic hardship if any new performance fee is imposed, as will many other small businesses that play music including bars, restaurants, retail establishments, sports and other entertainment venues, shopping centers and transportation facilities; and   
 Whereas the hardship that would result from a new performance fee would hurt American businesses, and ultimately the American consumers who rely on local radio for news, weather, and entertainment; and such a performance fee is not justified when the current system has produced the most prolific and innovative broadcasting, music, and sound recording industries in the world: Now, therefore, be it       That Congress should not impose any new performance fee, tax, royalty, or other charge relating to the public performance of sound recordings on a local radio station for broadcasting sound recordings over the air, or on any business for such public performance of sound recordings."

Reg. 7037) that revoked the March 2019 Presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline: Now, therefore, be it 
 
 That Congress disapproves of the revocation by President Biden of the Presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline."
