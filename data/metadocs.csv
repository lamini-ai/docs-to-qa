 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 10 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 25, 2023 Mr. Tiffany  (for himself,  Mr. Perry ,  Mr. Donalds ,  Mrs. Steel ,  Mr. Norman ,  Mr. Ogles ,  Mr. LaMalfa ,  Mr. Owens ,  Mr. Good of Virginia ,  Mr. Weber of Texas ,  Mr. LaTurner ,  Ms. Malliotakis ,  Mr. DesJarlais ,  Mr. Gooden of Texas ,  Mr. Carter of Georgia ,  Ms. Mace ,  Mrs. McClain ,  Mr. Crenshaw , and  Mr. McClintock ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Foreign Affairs , and in addition to the Committee on  Ways and Means , for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Expressing the sense of Congress that the United States should resume normal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, negotiate a bilateral free trade agreement with Taiwan, and support Taiwan’s membership in international organizations. 
 Whereas the people of Taiwan have established a free, open, pluralistic, and democratic society;   Whereas the people of Taiwan have conducted 7 democratic Presidential elections yielding 3 peaceful transfers of power, successive parliamentary elections, multiple nationwide referenda, and numerous local elections; 
 Whereas Taiwan and its outlying islands have never been under the jurisdiction or control of the Communist regime in Beijing, which continues to illegitimately claim sovereignty over Taiwan and its people;   Whereas Communist China has weaponized the so-called  One China Policy  to block Taiwan’s membership and full participation in international organizations and events ranging from the United Nations and the World Health Organization to the Olympic Games; 
 Whereas the so-called  One China Policy  is obsolete, does not serve the people of Taiwan or the United States, and fails to reflect the obvious reality that Taiwan has been a sovereign and independent country for over 70 years;   Whereas Taiwan maintains diplomatic, cultural, and economic links with several countries around the world, demonstrating its clear and indisputable independence from the People’s Republic of China; 
 Whereas Taiwan and the United States maintained normal diplomatic relations and a Mutual Defense Treaty until President Carter abruptly abandoned both without the approval of Congress in 1979;   Whereas Congress responded by adopting the landmark, bipartisan Taiwan Relations Act, codifying in law the basis for continued friendly relations between the people of the United States and Taiwan; 
 Whereas former President Reagan strengthened ties with Taiwan by issuing the  Six Assurances , noting that  The United States has not altered its position regarding sovereignty over Taiwan , underscoring that Communist Chinese claims of sovereignty over Taiwan have never been accepted by the United States;   Whereas former President Clinton declared  that the issues between Beijing and Taiwan must be resolved peacefully and with the assent of the people of Taiwan ; 
 Whereas President Trump approved the sale of defense articles to Taiwan and signed bipartisan legislation allowing for expanded high-level exchanges and cooperation between Taiwanese and American officials; and   Whereas Taiwan remains a steadfast ally of the United States and a responsible and conscientious member of the international community: Now, therefore, be it 
 That—   (1) the United States commends the people of Taiwan for their commitment to democracy, civil liberties, and human rights; and 
 (2) it is the sense of Congress that—   (A) the President should abandon the antiquated  One China Policy  in favor of a policy that recognizes the objective reality that Taiwan is an independent country not governed by or included within the territory of the People’s Republic of China; 
 (B) the President should recognize the legitimacy of the democratically elected National Government in Taipei, normalize diplomatic relations between our two nations, appoint a United States ambassador to Taiwan, and receive a Taiwanese ambassador to the United States;   (C) the President should rescind arbitrary agency guidelines that restrict normal communication and interaction between United States and Taiwanese officials; 
 (D) the United States Trade Representative should initiate formal negotiations with Taiwan on the establishment of a United States-Taiwan Free Trade Agreement; and   (E) the President, the Permanent Representative of the United States to the United Nations, and other relevant United States officials should take steps to advocate for Taiwan’s full membership in the United Nations and other international organizations in which the United States is a member.","[{'bioguideId': 'T000165', 'firstName': 'Thomas', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 12 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES February 1, 2023 Mrs. Cammack  (for herself,  Mr. Kildee ,  Ms. Letlow ,  Mr. C. Scott Franklin of Florida , and  Mr. Higgins of Louisiana ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Ways and Means , and in addition to the Committee on  Agriculture , for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Expressing the sense of Congress that all direct and indirect subsidies that benefit the production or export of sugar by all major sugar-producing and -consuming countries should be eliminated. 
 Whereas most major sugar-producing and sugar-consuming countries in the world maintain some form of direct or indirect subsidy to support its sugar growers, processors, or consumers;   Whereas virtually all of the more than 100 countries that produce sugar maintain market-distorting subsidy programs, including— 
 (1) the Government of Brazil which provides direct and indirect subsidies of at least $2,500,000,000 per year for programs to promote its sugar industry and has increased subsidies in recent years, including preferential loans and debt forgiveness;   (2) the Government of India which provided nearly $14,000,000,000 per year in subsidy supports as recently as 2018 to prop up its inefficient sugar industry, including the provision of export subsidies in 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019, and 2020 in potential violation of World Trade Organization obligations; 
 (3) the Government of Thailand which more than tripled its sugar exports after 2004 by providing at least $1,300,000,000 in annual subsidies and government programs to its sugar industry and by maintaining domestic prices well above export prices;   (4) the Governments of the European Union member states which have provided support with an estimated value of $685,000,000 per year to their sugar farmers; 
 (5) the Government of Russia which transformed its country from one of the world’s largest net importers of sugar to a net exporter on the basis of government support estimated at an estimated value of $392,000,000 per year from 2010 to 2017; and    (6) the Government of Mexico which has generously supported its sugarcane growers, and was found guilty in 2014 of injuring United States sugar producers by dumping subsidized sugar into the United States market; 
 Whereas the world sugar market is the most volatile commodity market in the world;   Whereas many countries routinely dump surplus sugar on the world sugar market, at prices below domestic price levels and costs of production; 
 Whereas the foregoing clauses provide ample evidence there is no undistorted, free market in sugar in the world today; and   Whereas, if such a free market did exist, United States sugar farmers and processors could compete effectively in that market: Now, therefore, be it 
 That it is the sense of Congress that—   (1) the President should seek elimination of all direct and indirect subsidies benefiting the production or export of sugar by the government of— 
 (A) each country that exported more than 200,000 metric tons of sugar in 2018, 2019, or 2020; and   (B) by any other country with which the United States has in effect a free trade agreement; 
 (2) if the President determines that all such subsidies by all such countries have been eliminated, the President should submit a report to Congress providing detailed information about how each of the countries has eliminated such subsidies; and   (3) after submitting such a report, the President should propose to Congress legislation to implement United States sugar policy reforms.","[{'bioguideId': 'C001039', 'firstName': 'Kat', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
 Supporting the Local Radio Freedom Act. 
 
 
 Whereas the United States enjoys broadcasting and sound recording industries that are the envy of the world, due to the symbiotic relationship that has existed among these industries for many decades;     Whereas, for nearly a century, Congress has rejected repeated calls by the recording industry to impose a performance fee on local radio stations for simply playing music on the radio and upsetting the mutually beneficial relationship between local radio and the recording industry;   
 Whereas local radio stations provide free publicity and promotion to the recording industry and performers of music in the form of radio air play, interviews with performers, introduction of new performers, concert promotions, and publicity that promotes the sale of music, concert tickets, ring tones, music videos and associated merchandise;     Whereas Congress found that  the sale of many sound recordings and the careers of many performers benefited considerably from airplay and other promotional activities provided by both noncommercial and advertiser-supported, free over-the-air broadcasting ;   
 Whereas local radio broadcasters provide tens of thousands of hours of essential local news and weather information during times of national emergencies and natural disasters, as well as public affairs programming, sports, and hundreds of millions of dollars of time for public service announcements and local fundraising efforts for worthy charitable causes, all of which are jeopardized if local radio stations are forced to divert revenues to pay for a new performance fee;     Whereas there are many thousands of local radio stations that will suffer severe economic hardship if any new performance fee is imposed, as will many other small businesses that play music including bars, restaurants, retail establishments, sports and other entertainment venues, shopping centers and transportation facilities; and   
 Whereas the hardship that would result from a new performance fee would hurt American businesses, and ultimately the American consumers who rely on local radio for news, weather, and entertainment; and such a performance fee is not justified when the current system has produced the most prolific and innovative broadcasting, music, and sound recording industries in the world: Now, therefore, be it       That Congress should not impose any new performance fee, tax, royalty, or other charge relating to the public performance of sound recordings on a local radio station for broadcasting sound recordings over the air, or on any business for such public performance of sound recordings.","[{'bioguideId': 'W000809', 'firstName': 'Steve', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 16 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES February 17, 2023 Mr. DeSaulnier  (for himself,  Ms. Lee of California , and  Mr. Garamendi ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Armed Services CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Recognizing the victims of the Port Chicago explosion of July 17, 1944, the 79th anniversary of the greatest homeland loss of life of World War II, and exonerating the 50 African-American sailors unjustly court-martialed by the Navy. Whereas the Port Chicago Naval Magazine in Contra Costa County, California, was a vital supply facility for the Navy during World War II, shipping ordinance for use in the Pacific Theater; Whereas, under the rules governing the Navy at the time, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine was operated as a segregated facility in which undertrained and poorly equipped African-American sailors, under the supervision of White officers, exclusively conducted the hazardous task of loading munitions aboard ships; Whereas there had been numerous complaints and warnings about the unsafe nature of the loading operations, including the conduct of contests by White officers to achieve the most rapid loading of ships despite the inherent dangers involved in such actions; Whereas, on the night of July 17, 1944, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine and much of the town of Port Chicago were destroyed by a cataclysmic explosion that killed 320 men, 202 of whom were African-American enlisted men; Whereas these losses on a single night represented one-fifth of all African-American naval casualties during World War II; Whereas, following the catastrophe, none of the African-American survivors was provided survivor leave or other recuperative services provided to the White personnel, including the officers; Whereas African-American survivors of the explosion were ordered back to the Port Chicago site to conduct cleanup operations; Whereas, on August 9, 1944, with no cause having been determined for the explosion and no additional training having been provided to the African-American loaders, 328 men from three divisions were ordered to the loading pier at the nearby Mare Island, which served as the Port Chicago replacement facility; Whereas many of the men expressed concern about the inadequacy of safety procedures and training, leading to 258 being arrested and confined for three days on a large barge tiered to the pier; Whereas the confined sailors were threatened with prosecution and potential execution, leading 208 to return to work; Whereas the 50 who refused to return to loading operations were subjected to the largest mass mutiny trial in naval history, which resulted, on October 24, 1944, in a conviction on the charge of mutiny and a sentence of up to 15 years imprisonment and dishonorable discharge from the Navy; Whereas, after appeals and widespread protests in January 1946, which included the participation of future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, the Port Chicago men were released from prison but their convictions remained on their records; Whereas, in a 1994 investigation, the United States Navy stated that  there is no doubt that racial prejudice was responsible for the posting of only African-American enlisted personnel to loading divisions at Port Chicago ; Whereas the unfairness of the Port Chicago mutiny prosecution would ultimately serve as one of the catalysts for the 1948 Executive order requiring desegregation of the Armed Services; Whereas the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of Representatives conducted hearings on the Port Chicago case in 1993 and, in 1994, Congress, on a bipartisan basis, passed legislation creating the Port Chicago National Memorial as a feature of the National Park Service, including plaques commemorating those who lost their lives at the site in 1944; Whereas, in 1999, a pardon was granted to one of the few surviving members of the Port Chicago 50, Freddie Meeks, by President William Clinton following a thorough review of the case; Whereas, since 1999, substantial legal, academic, and journalistic inquiry has documented the inherent racial motivation behind the operations at Port Chicago and the prosecution of the Port Chicago 50; Whereas, on December 16, 2015, the Secretary of the Navy, the Honorable Ray Mabus, wrote to the President  strongly support[ing] executive action in favor of the 49 remaining Sailors with general court-martial convictions or the 207 with summary court-martial convictions … in light of the well documented challenges associated with uniformed service by African Americans during that era. ; Whereas, in 2000, Congress approved S.J. Res. 26 to posthumously exonerate Captain Charles B. McVay III, captain of the USS Indianapolis, for his wrongful court martial, and President William Clinton signed that resolution on October 30, 2000; Whereas the language of that resolution was enacted as section 545 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 ( Public Law 106–398 ), including language that Captain McVay’s military record  should now reflect that he is exonerated for the loss of the USS Indianapolis and so many of her crew ; and Whereas, on July 17, 2023, the Nation will mark the 79th anniversary of the Port Chicago disaster, and the unjust and racially motivated convictions remain on the records of the Port Chicago 50: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— (1) recognizes the service and sacrifice of those who served and perished at Port Chicago during World War II; (2) hereby and forever exonerates the Port Chicago sailors of the charge of mutiny against the United States and any and all other charges brought against them in the aftermath of the July 17, 1944, explosion; (3) upgrades the general and summary discharges issued to each of the Port Chicago sailors to honorable discharges; and (4) directs the Secretary of the Navy to place a letter attesting to these actions in the file of each of the Port Chicago sailors and to notify any surviving family members of these actions.","[{'bioguideId': 'D000623', 'firstName': 'Mark', 'fullName': 'Rep.

RES. 17 [Report No. 118–27] IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES February 17, 2023 Mr. Guthrie  submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Energy and Commerce March 23, 2023 Additional sponsors:  Mr. Duncan ,  Mr. Joyce of Pennsylvania ,  Mr. Balderson ,  Mr. Palmer ,  Mr. Pfluger ,  Mr. Bucshon ,  Mr. Curtis ,  Mr. Crenshaw , and  Mrs. Lesko March 23, 2023 Reported with an amendment, referred to the House Calendar, and ordered to be printed Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the part printed in italic For text of introduced resolution, see copy of resolution as introduced on February 17, 2023 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Expressing the sense of Congress that the Federal Government should not impose any restrictions on the export of crude oil or other petroleum products. Whereas the United States has enjoyed a renaissance in energy production, with the expansion of domestic crude oil and other petroleum product production contributing to enhanced energy security and significant economic benefits to the national economy; Whereas, in 2015, Congress recognized the need to adapt to changing crude oil market conditions and repealed all restrictions on the export of crude oil on a bipartisan basis; Whereas section 101 of title I of division O of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 ( 42 U.S.C. 6212a ) established the national policy on oil export restriction, prohibiting any official of the Federal Government from imposing or enforcing any restrictions on the export of crude oil with limited exceptions, including a savings clause maintaining the authority to prohibit exports under any provision of law that imposes sanctions on a foreign person or foreign government (including any provision of law that prohibits or restricts United States persons from engaging in a transaction with a sanctioned person or government), including a foreign government that is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism;  Whereas lifting the restrictions on crude oil exports encouraged additional domestic energy production, created American jobs and economic development, and allowed the United States to emerge as the leading oil producer in the world; Whereas, in 2019, the United States became a net exporter of petroleum products for the first time since 1952, and the reliance of the United States on foreign imports of petroleum products has declined to historic lows; and Whereas free trade, open markets, and competition have contributed to the rise of the United States as a global energy superpower: Now, therefore, be it That it is the sense of Congress that the Federal Government should not impose— (1) overly restrictive regulations on the exploration, production, or marketing of energy resources; or (2) any restrictions on the export of crude oil or other petroleum products under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act ( 42 U.S.C. 6201 et seq. ), except with respect to the export of crude oil or other petroleum products to a foreign person or foreign government subject to sanctions under any provision of United States law, including to a country the government of which is designated as a state sponsor of terrorism.

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 19 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES February 17, 2023 Ms. Williams of Georgia  (for herself and  Mr. Swalwell ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on House Administration CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Prohibiting President Donald Trump and certain other individuals who attempted to undermine and overturn the 2020 presidential election from entering the United States Capitol. Whereas following the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol, the House of Representatives voted on a bipartisan basis to establish the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol; Whereas during the Select Committee's investigation the House of Representatives held Steve Bannon, Mark Meadows, Dan Scavino, and Peter Navarro in criminal contempt of Congress and certified those contempts to the Department of Justice for prosecution;  Whereas, on December 19, 2022, the Select Committee referred Donald Trump, John Eastman, Mark Meadows, Rudy Giuliani, Jeffrey Clark, and Kenneth Cheseboro for criminal prosecution; Whereas, on December 22, 2022, the Select Committee released its final report describing the effort to undermine and overturn the 2020 election, which culminated in the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021; Whereas part of that report described the role that Donald Trump, Steven Bannon, Mark Meadows, Jeffrey Clark, John Eastman, Kenneth Cheseboro, Rudy Giuliani, Dan Scavino, and Peter Navarro played in the planning and execution of the efforts to undermine and overturn the 2020 presidential election; Whereas the effort to undermine and overturn the 2020 presidential election damaged the functions of our democracy; Whereas the effort to undermine and overturn the 2020 presidential election damaged the integrity of Congress’s constitutional role in certifying the election results; Whereas the effort to undermine and overturn the 2020 presidential election and the subsequent attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, were an attack on the constitutional requirement that Congress be formed pursuant to and held accountable to the will of the people; Whereas the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, claimed the lives of five law enforcement officers and put the lives of Members of Congress and the Vice President of the United States in genuine peril; Whereas the continuation of democracy in the United States is an active process that requires the vigilance and action of those who seek to preserve it; and Whereas the continuation of democracy in the United States requires accountability for those who seek to damage it: Now, therefore, be it 1. Prohibiting President Trump and certain other individuals who attempted to undermine and overturn the 2020 presidential election from entering United States Capitol The Sergeant at Arms of the House of Representatives, the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, and the United States Capitol Police shall take such actions as may be necessary to prohibit President Donald John Trump, Steve Bannon, Mark Meadows, Dan Scavino, Peter Navarro, Jeffrey Clark, John Eastman, Kenneth Cheseboro, and Rudy Giuliani from entering the United States Capitol.","[{'bioguideId': 'W000788', 'firstName': 'Nikema', 'fullName': 'Rep.

RES. 2 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 9, 2023 Mr. Buck  (for himself,  Mr. Reschenthaler ,  Mr. Fitzgerald ,  Mr. Wenstrup , and  Mrs. Hinson ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on the Judiciary CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Expressing support for the Nation’s law enforcement agencies and condemning any efforts to defund or dismantle law enforcement agencies. Whereas law enforcement officers protect the American people from criminals who seek to perpetrate violence and harm innocent lives regardless of the political circumstances of the day; Whereas the brave men and women of the law enforcement community continually summon the courage to fulfill their solemn oath to ensure the safety of our communities and provide peace of mind for our Nation’s citizens; Whereas America’s law enforcement community also seeks to assist the communities they serve through a variety of nontraditional means, including nonarrest pathways that connect individuals with treatment and recovery programs to overcome addiction, and juvenile diversion programs to prevent minors from entering the criminal justice system; Whereas supporting law enforcement officers with the equipment, training, and funding necessary to serve our communities and keep our streets safe has long been a bipartisan issue, dating back to President Clinton and then-Senator Biden joining their Republican colleagues to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994; Whereas law enforcement officers willingly face dangerous circumstances and the threat of serious bodily injury or death on a daily basis to ensure the safety of all Americans; Whereas the National Law Enforcement Memorial and Museum’s 2021 Law Enforcement Officers Fatalities Report detailed that 458 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty in 2021, an increase of 55 percent from the previous year, including 62 officers who were killed in firearms-related incidents and 301 officers who were killed by COVID–19; Whereas protests have been hijacked by violent extremists seeking to sow discord, damage property, loot businesses, and inflict harm against civilians and law enforcement officers; Whereas law enforcement officers have been run over, shot, hit with objects, and stabbed attempting to maintain peace and the rule of law; Whereas progressive politicians and interest groups have responded to this violence with calls to defund law enforcement agencies across the Nation; Whereas defunding or otherwise handcuffing law enforcement officers will make officers less likely to intervene in dangerous situations and will result in law enforcement pulling back from the neighborhoods they are entrusted to protect; Whereas violent crime increases when law enforcement is forced to withdraw from neighborhoods; Whereas the vilification of the Nation’s law enforcement officers and the embracing of hateful rhetoric against these brave men and women only places them further in harm’s way; Whereas these brave men and women must operate in an environment where their moral and legal authority is constantly being scrutinized, and they undertake the critical yet difficult task of addressing the actions of those affected by addiction, homelessness, and mental illness; and Whereas efforts to defund police departments will cause irreparable and lasting damage to the Nation: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— (1) offers its sincere gratitude and appreciation to the Nation’s law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities;  (2) recognizes the great sacrifice our law enforcement officers make to keep the Nation safe; and (3) rejects the misguided and dangerous efforts to defund and dismantle the Nation’s law enforcement agencies.","[{'bioguideId': 'B001297', 'firstName': 'Ken', 'fullName': 'Rep.

Whereas section 6(d) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 ( 29 U.S.C. 206(d) ) prohibits discrimination in compensation for equal work on the basis of sex; Whereas title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ( 42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq. ) prohibits discrimination in compensation because of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex; Whereas, nearly six decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 ( 29 U.S.C. 206  note), Census Bureau data show that women working full time, year round are paid an average of 84 cents for every dollar paid to men, while Asian-American women working full time, year round are paid 92 cents, White, non-Hispanic women working full time, year round are paid 80 cents, African-American women working full time, year round are paid 67 cents, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander women working full time, year round are paid 65 cents, American Indian and Alaska Native women working full time, year round are paid 57 cents, and Latinas working full time, year round are paid 57 cents for every dollar paid to White, non-Hispanic men; Whereas March 14, 2023, is Equal Pay Day, marking the day that symbolizes how long into 2023 women must work to make what men were paid in 2022; Whereas April 5, 2023, is Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Women’s Equal Pay Day; August 30, 2023, is Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander Women’s Equal Pay Day; July 27, 2023, is Black Women’s Equal Pay Day; November 30, 2023, is Native Women’s Equal Pay Day; and October 5, 2023, is Latinas’ Equal Pay Day; Whereas, if current trends continue, Asian women are projected to close the gender pay gap for all workers, including part-time, full time, and seasonal workers, in 24 years, White women in 43 years, Black women in 121 years, and Latinas in 187 years; Whereas the disparity in median annual earnings for women and men working full time, year round is $9,954, which can add up to nearly $400,000 over a career; Whereas women’s median earnings are less than men’s at every level of academic achievement, with women with less than a high school diploma earning 78 percent of men’s earnings, and women with a professional degree earning 70 percent of men’s earnings at the same level of education; Whereas women are often paid less than men with lower levels of education, with women with associate’s degrees paid less than men with a high school diploma, and women with master’s degrees paid less than men with bachelor’s degrees; Whereas, in the United States, mothers are breadwinners in more than half of families with children under 18, and mothers working full time typically are paid 74 percent of what fathers are paid; Whereas the gender wage gap collectively costs women employed full time in the United States more than $958,000,000,000 in annual lost wages, so that families have less money to spend on goods and services that help drive economic growth; Whereas, if the annual gender wage gap were eliminated, on average, a working woman in the United States would have enough money for approximately 1 year of childcare, 8 additional months of rent, 6 additional months of mortgage and utilities payments, the full cost of tuition and fees for attending a 2-year college, more than 6 additional months of premiums for employer-based health insurance, more than 8 additional years of birth control, more than 62 weeks of food, or enough money to pay off student loan debt in just under 4 years; Whereas women hold nearly two-thirds of the Nation’s $1,700,000,000,000 in outstanding student loan debt, totaling over $929,000,000,000, and are less likely to be able to pay off their student loan debt promptly due to wage disparities; Whereas the wage gap impacts women’s ability to save for retirement and women’s total Social Security and pension benefits, and older women are more likely than men to live in poverty; Whereas sex discrimination in education, hiring, and promotion has played a role in maintaining a workforce segregated by sex; Whereas sex-based wage differentials— (1) depress employee wages and living standards necessary for health and well-being; (2) reduce family incomes and contribute to the higher poverty rates among women and their families; and (3) prevent the effective and maximum utilization of available labor resources; Whereas a wage gap exists in nearly every occupational field, but opening traditionally male-dominated jobs to women and reducing occupational segregation by sex increases earnings for women; Whereas nearly two-thirds of workers paid the minimum wage or less are women, and the concentration of women in low-wage jobs is a significant contributor to the wage gap; Whereas the gender wage gap between union women and men is about half the size of the wage gap between nonunion women and men, and women union members typically earn $214 more per week than women who are not represented by unions; Whereas, as much as 38 percent of the wage gap is unexplained by observable factors such as variation in educational attainment, industry, and occupation, and may reflect discrimination; Whereas two-thirds of private sector workers report that employers either prohibit or discourage them from discussing their pay, which can keep the existence of pay discrimination hidden and prevent remedying that discrimination; Whereas the lack of family-friendly policies, such as access to affordable, quality childcare, paid family and medical leave, paid sick days, and fair and predictable work schedules, forces many caregivers to choose between providing for their families financially and ensuring their loved ones receive quality care, and contributes to the wage gap; Whereas 1 in 3 women have been on the receiving end of sexual harassment during their careers, and an estimated 87 to 94 percent of those who experience sexual harassment never file a formal complaint; Whereas workplace harassment forces many women to leave their occupation or industry, or pass up opportunities for advancement, and this contributes to the gender wage gap; Whereas equal pay strengthens the economic security of families and enhances retirement savings; Whereas, when women are paid fairly, families are stronger, businesses prosper, and American values and the economy are strengthened; Whereas, if women in the United States received equal pay comparable with men, poverty for working women would be reduced by half, and the economy would add $5,120,000,000 annually, based on a 2017 analysis; Whereas the economic fallout from the COVID–19 pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on women and women of color, with women losing the majority of jobs lost since March 2020; Whereas, since women earn less on average than their male partners, 3 times more women than men have left the workforce to look after their children who are learning from home; Whereas women and women of color are now experiencing the lowest rates of employment in decades; and Whereas numerous national organizations have designated Wednesday, March 14, 2023, as  Equal Pay Day  to represent the additional time that women must work to compensate for the average 16-percent lower wages paid to women working full time, year round last year: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— (1) recognizes the disparity between wages paid to women and men and its impact on women, families, and the Nation; and (2) reaffirms its commitment to supporting equal pay and to narrowing the gender wage gap.","[{'bioguideId': 'F000462', 'firstName': 'Lois', 'fullName': 'Rep.

Whereas March 10 has been established as a day to show appreciation for the essential, high-quality care that abortion providers and clinic staff provide to their communities and those traveling to their communities, and to celebrate their courage, compassion, and dedication to their work; Whereas this date is established in honor of Dr. David Gunn who was killed outside his abortion clinic in Pensacola, Florida, by a White supremacist, antiabortion extremist, in the first known instance of the murder of an abortion provider on March 10, 1993; Whereas, on June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, reversing decades of legal precedent affirming the right to an abortion and unleashing devastation on an already precarious abortion access landscape; Whereas, following the Supreme Court’s decision, States across the country moved to further restrict access to abortion care; Whereas, as of March 2023, at least 17 States either severely restrict access to abortion care or ban abortion entirely; Whereas, because of State abortion bans, scores of clinics in already underserved areas were forced to close and more patients forced to travel to other States, increasing wait times at clinics, straining already thin resources, and pushing people further and further away from their homes;  Whereas abortion providers and clinic staff play a critical role in a world where it has become increasingly difficult for people to be able to make essential and time-sensitive decisions about their bodies, lives, and futures; Whereas abortion providers and clinic staff help to ensure that all people who can become pregnant can make their own decisions about their bodies and their pregnancies, and support their patients’ decisions by treating them with dignity, empathy, compassion, and respect, despite numerous challenges due to abortion bans and restrictions; Whereas abortion providers and clinic staff play an essential role within the reproductive justice framework, which was created by 12 Black women in 1994 who determined the necessity of adopting a human rights framework that demands every person has the human right to bodily autonomy, which includes if, when, and how to have children, to not have children, and to parent the children they have in safe and sustainable communities; Whereas people seeking abortion care across the United States also rely on the work of abortion funds and practical support organizations to access abortion care for themselves and their families; Whereas abortion funds and practical support organizations that rely on donations face increasing demand following the Dobbs decision as people are forced into the vicious cycle of having to travel longer distances, find childcare or lodging, and raise money to obtain an abortion and cover associated costs; Whereas restrictions on accessing abortion care have far-reaching consequences in both deepening existing inequities caused by White supremacy, structural racism, and systemic discrimination in the maternal health care system and worsening health outcomes for pregnant people, people giving birth, and their families; Whereas the effects of the Dobbs decision were immediate and disastrous, as of March 2023 abortion is entirely banned in 12 States, meaning a total of 71,000,000 people, or over 20 percent of the United States population, live in a State where abortion is illegal; Whereas restricting and banning access to abortion care creates and increases the out-of-pocket costs and logistical burdens that patients face to get care, which are sometimes insurmountable, forcing people to remain pregnant while exposing the remaining abortion providers and staff to increased levels of harassment and politically motivated restrictions; Whereas the National Abortion Federation’s 2021 statistics on violence and disruption found an alarming escalation in incidents of obstruction, vandalism, and trespassing at abortion clinics, with abortion providers reporting an alarming rate of death threats and threats of harm, with 182 incidents in 2021; Whereas Black, indigenous, and other providers and patients of color face heightened levels of threats, harassment, and violence as compared to their white counterparts; Whereas the Dobbs decision has emboldened antiabortion individuals and groups to continue to harass providers and the patients they care for; Whereas the unraveling or overturning of Roe v. Wade threatens the ability of abortion providers and the clinic staff who support them to serve their patients; and Whereas in the face of multifaceted attacks on their work, abortion providers remain an essential and valued part of their communities, providing high-quality, compassionate, and necessary health care, and courageously delivering this care despite pressures, restrictions, political interference, and violent threats to their personal safety: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— (1) recognizes Abortion Provider Appreciation Day to celebrate the courage, compassion, and high-quality care that abortion providers and clinic staff offer to patients and their families across the country; (2) lauds communities across the country who are proud to be home to abortion providers and clinic staff;  (3) affirms Congress’ commitment to ensuring the safety of abortion providers, their ability to continue providing the essential care their patients need, and the right of their patients to access abortion care no matter where they live, free from fear of violence, criminalization, or stigma; (4) condemns the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which has had a devastating impact on abortion providers and the communities they care for, threatening the work and livelihoods of providers and clinic staff, and worsening the strain on providers who work in States where abortion is still available; and (5) declares a vision for a future where access to abortion is liberated from restrictions and bans universally, and affirms Congress’ commitment to working toward this goal in partnership with providers, patients, advocates, and their communities.","[{'bioguideId': 'P000617', 'firstName': 'Ayanna', 'fullName': 'Rep.

Whereas Article V of the Constitution of the United States states that  The Congress … on the Application of the Legislatures of two thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments  to the Constitution; Whereas congressional and State records of plenary applications for amendments on any subject and applications for the single subject of Inflation-fighting Fiscal Responsibility Amendments compiled by the Article V Library counts Nevada’s  continuing  application, reported February 8, 1979, in the Congressional Record, as the 34th thus achieving the  two thirds  congressional mandate to call the Convention for proposing amendments; congressional records reported 39 applications by the end of 1979, 40 in 1983, and 42 total applications over time; Whereas Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 85 stated that  The Congress  shall call a Convention . Nothing in this particular is left to the discretion of that body ; Whereas beginning in 1979, when Congress appears to have failed in its constitutional duty to count applications and call a  Convention for proposing Amendments , the Nation’s debt has increased to more than $31 trillion from $860 billion, while the value of the dollar has declined by over 75 percent; Whereas the Constitution was ratified by Convention delegates  chosen in each State by the People thereof , and the 21st Amendment, repealing Prohibition, was ratified in 1933 by a vote of the people for Yes-pledged delegates in 38 of 39 State Conventions; and Whereas the Supreme Court’s unanimous opinion in Chiafalo v. Washington stated:  electors . . . have no ground for reversing the vote of millions of its citizens. That direction accords with the Constitution—as well as with the trust of the Nation that here, We the People rule. : Now, therefore, be it That 1. Call for Article V Convention of States (a) In general (1) Call for convention; timing As provided in Article V of the Constitution of the United States, and except as provided in paragraph (2), Congress hereby calls a Convention for proposing amendments to the Constitution of the United States for a date and place to be determined on calling the Convention. (2) Exception Paragraph (1) does not apply if, prior to the expiration of the 60-day period which begins on the date of the adoption of this concurrent resolution— (A) the House Clerk provides a written report stating there have never been unrescinded and  continuing  applications for a Convention to propose amendments from at least two-thirds (34) of the States on any national issues (plenary) plus the single issue of fiscal responsibility; and (B) the House Clerk includes in the report detailed findings for each State. (b) Ratification of amendments by states Each proposed amendment at the Convention for proposing amendments called under this section shall be ratified by a vote of We the People in three-quarters (38) of the States via State Convention delegates who shall  have no ground for reversing the vote of millions of its citizens  (Chiafalo v. Washington). 2. Transmission to administrator of general services A copy of this concurrent resolution shall be transmitted to the Administrator of General Services for submission to the legislatures of the several States.","[{'bioguideId': 'A000375', 'firstName': 'Jodey', 'fullName': 'Rep.

RES. 27 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES March 23, 2023 Mr. Keating  (for himself,  Mr. Kean of New Jersey ,  Mr. Cohen ,  Mr. Wilson of South Carolina ,  Mr. Quigley ,  Ms. Lee of California ,  Mr. Smith of New Jersey ,  Mr. Moskowitz ,  Mr. McGovern , and  Mr. Sherman ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Foreign Affairs CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Condemning Russia’s unjust and arbitrary detention of Russian opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza who has stood up in defense of democracy, the rule of law, and free and fair elections in Russia. Whereas, on April 11, 2022, Vladimir Kara-Murza was unjustly detained by Russian authorities for spreading supposedly  false information  in a speech in March 2022 to the Arizona House of Representatives; Whereas Mr. Kara-Murza in his March 15, 2022, speech presented a defiant condemnation of Vladimir Putin’s policies and leadership outlining his corruption and malign intentions, and condemning the illegal war of aggression Putin has unleashed against Ukraine;  Whereas, prior to his arrest in April 2022, Mr. Kara-Murza was poisoned twice by agents of the Russian Government and the Russian Federation in 2015 and 2017 with a military-grade agent banned internationally, likely in retaliation for his defiant stance in support of rule of law and democracy in Russia; Whereas, despite having survived two assassination attempts and the subsequent side effects of these poisonings, Mr. Kara-Murza regularly returned to Russia to advocate for democratic representation in Russia; Whereas Mr. Kara-Murza has consistently advocated for democracy in Russia and insisted that democracy in Russia must be advanced by Russians for all those living in Russia; Whereas, in August 2022, new charges were brought against Mr. Kara-Murza for  carrying out the activities  of an  undesirable foreign organization  and his arrest was extended for his work as a leading member of Russian civil society; Whereas, in October 2022, Mr. Kara-Murza was further charged unjustly with  high treason  in part due to his public condemnations of the Kremlin’s military aggression on Ukraine and domestic repressions; Whereas Mr. Kara-Murza remains in pretrial detention and faces a prison sentence of up to 24 years on high treason and other charges; Whereas the state of Mr. Kara-Murza’s health has deteriorated and in addition to losing over 45 pounds, he was diagnosed with polyneuropathy, a condition that under Russian law should preclude him from his current detainment; Whereas, as a result of his diagnosis, he has lost feeling in both his feet and has experienced symptoms similar to those he experienced following his 2015 poisoning due to peripheral nerve damage; Whereas section 5599F of the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 ( Public Law 117–263 ) condemned Mr. Kara-Murza’s unjust detention, expressed solidarity with Mr. Kara-Murza, his family, and all individuals imprisoned in Russia for their beliefs, and urged the United States and other ally governments to work to secure the release of Mr. Kara-Murza and other citizens of the Russian Federation imprisoned for opposition to Vladimir Putin’s regime and his illegal war in Ukraine; Whereas, in April 2022, Vladimir Kara-Murza was presented the McCain Institute’s Courage and Leadership Award for his unwavering commitment to fundamental values and his acts of selfless courage which have inspired the world; Whereas, in October 2022, Mr. Kara-Murza was awarded the Vaclav Havel Prize honoring outstanding civil society action in defense of human rights; Whereas the late Senator John McCain said Mr. Kara-Murza  is a brave, outspoken, and relentless advocate for freedom and democracy in Russia  and introduced Mr. Kara-Murza as  a personal hero whose courage, selflessness, and idealism I find awe-inspiring ;  Whereas, in March 2023, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of State imposed Global Magnitsky and other targeted sanctions on six Russians involved in Mr. Kara-Murza’s ongoing arbitrary detention, recognized his role as  a major advocate for the adoption of Magnitsky-style sanctions authorities by the United States, Canada, European Union, and United Kingdom to target human rights abusers and corrupt actors in Russia , and called for his immediate release; and  Whereas Mr. Kara-Murza remains a political prisoner and a victim of Vladimir Putin’s authoritarian state: Now, therefore, be it  That Congress— (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the unjust and arbitrary detention of Russian democratic opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza; (2) calls on the Russian Federation to immediately release Mr. Kara-Murza and all other Russian opposition leaders who are detained as a result of their opposition to the Putin regime; (3) calls on all Russian citizens to outright condemn Russia’s illegal and unjust invasion of Ukraine in the spirit of Mr. Kara-Murza’s defiant opposition stance in front of the Arizona House of Representatives in March 2022; (4) expresses solidarity and calls for the release of all political prisoners in Russia and Belarus as well as Ukrainian citizens illegally held as prisoners by Putin’s regime in violation of the rule of law as a result of their support for liberal democratic values; and (5) calls on the President of the United States and leaders from across the free world to work tirelessly for the release of political prisoners in Russia and increase support for those advocating for democracy in Russia as well as independent media and civil society which Mr. Kara-Murza has worked to further.","[{'bioguideId': 'K000375', 'firstName': 'William', 'fullName': 'Rep.

Whereas the fraternal benefit societies of the United States are longstanding mutual aid organizations created more than a century ago to serve the needs of communities and provide for the payment of life, health, accident, and other benefits to their members; Whereas fraternal benefit societies represent a successful, modern-day model under which individuals come together with a common purpose to collectively provide charitable and other beneficial activities for society; Whereas fraternal benefit societies operate under a chapter system, creating a nationwide infrastructure, combined with local energy and knowledge, which positions fraternal benefit societies to most efficiently address unmet needs in communities, many of which the government cannot address; Whereas the fraternal benefit society model represents one of the largest member-volunteer networks in the United States, with approximately 7,000,000 people belonging to local chapters across the country; Whereas research has shown that the value of the work of fraternal benefit societies to society averages more than $3,800,000,000 per year, accounting for charitable giving, educational programs, and volunteer activities, as well as important social capital that strengthens the fabric, safety, and quality of life in thousands of local communities in the United States; Whereas, in 1909, Congress recognized the value of fraternal benefit societies and exempted those organizations from taxation, as later codified in  section 501(c)(8)  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986; Whereas fraternal benefit societies have adapted since 1909 to better serve the evolving needs of their members and the public; Whereas the efforts of fraternal benefit societies to help people of the United States save money and be financially secure relieves pressure on government safety net programs; and Whereas Congress recognizes that fraternal benefit societies have served their original purpose for more than a century, helping countless individuals, families, and communities through fraternal member activities: Now, therefore, be it That it is the sense of Congress that— (1) the fraternal benefit society model is a successful private sector economic and social support system that helps meet needs that would otherwise go unmet; (2) the provision of payment for life, health, accident, or other benefits to the members of fraternal benefit societies in accordance with  section 501(c)(8)  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is necessary to support the charitable and fraternal activities of the volunteer chapters within the communities of fraternal benefit societies; (3) fraternal benefit societies have adapted since 1909 to better serve their members and the public; and (4) the exemption from taxation under  section 501(c)(8)  of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 of fraternal benefit societies continues to generate significant returns to the United States, and the work of fraternal benefit societies should continue to be promoted.","[{'bioguideId': 'L000585', 'firstName': 'Darin', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
 Condemning the Russian Federation’s kidnapping of Ukrainian children. 
 
 
 Whereas, on February 24, 2022, the Russian Federation invaded the sovereign State of Ukraine in violation of international law;   Whereas Russian troops have since committed horrendous atrocities and human rights violations; 
 Whereas, as of March 2023, the Russian Government has kidnapped and removed tens of thousands of innocent children from their homes in Ukraine;   Whereas the Russian Government continues to falsely claim that the parents and families of these exploited children are dead; 
 Whereas the Russian Government is actively transporting these kidnapped children to  reeducation camps  and remote areas like Murmansk, Kamchatka, and the North Korean border where they have created dozens of new  child custody centers ;   Whereas, rather than a humanitarian project as Russia claims, these reeducation camps are designed to brainwash the young and malleable minds of children into supporting the horrors being committed in Ukraine and into supporting the empire of evil President Vladimir Putin seeks to construct by any means necessary; 
 Whereas this practice is in direct contradiction to any standard of reasonableness and civility;   Whereas this practice was employed by dictator Adolf Hitler; 
 Whereas this practice was employed by dictator Joseph Stalin;   Whereas this practice was employed by dictator Mao Zedong; 
 Whereas this practice was employed by dictator Pol Pot;   Whereas this practice was employed by dictator Augusto Pinochet; 
 Whereas this practice is historically associated with sadistic tyrants and dictators who pose a threat to humanity, world peace, prosperity, and human rights; and   Whereas children everywhere should be protected against all forms of neglect, cruelty, and exploitation: Now, therefore, be it 
 
 That Congress—   (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the Russian Federation’s abduction of innocent children from their families in Ukraine and relocation to reeducation camps where they are indoctrinated, abused, and exploited; 
 (2) rebukes every other nation that provides aid and support to the Russian Federation’s kidnapping enterprise;    (3) condemns forced adoption of Ukrainian children by Russian citizens contrary to international intercountry adoption norms and the Hague Convention governing intercountry adoption; and 
 (4) implores the Russian Federation to work with international human rights and children welfare organizations to ensure the return of Ukrainian children to their home country at the earliest available opportunity.","[{'bioguideId': 'B001298', 'firstName': 'Don', 'fullName': 'Rep.

Whereas, around the world, environmental defenders—individuals exercising their human rights to try to peacefully protect an area or the natural resources of such area from negative environmental impact by an ongoing or proposed activity—face persecution from government, private sector, and criminal actors, including restrictions on free speech and assembly, criminalization, civil lawsuits, surveillance, harassment, verbal, cyber, and physical intimidation, sexual assault, and targeted murder; Whereas at least 1,733 environmental defenders have been reported killed since 2012, with at least 200 killed in 2021; Whereas at least 1,179 environmental defenders have been reported killed in Latin America and the Caribbean since 2012, making it the region with the highest number of environmental defender deaths and persecution overall, exemplified by the cases of— (1) Homero Gómez González, who was forcibly disappeared and found dead in Mexico with reported signs of torture after fighting to protect the wintering grounds of the monarch butterfly from illegal logging; (2) Bruno Pereira, an advocate for the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil’s Amazon, who received threats and was murdered for standing up to illegal logging, mining, and drug trafficking;  (3) Berta Cáceres, a Lenca Indigenous woman, whose murder was ordered by the Honduran company, Desarrollos Energéticos SA, for organizing protests that led to the cancellation of the proposed Agua Zarca Dam; and (4) the Q’eqchi Mayan Indigenous community, which faces defamation, violent evictions, harassment, and assault by the Guatemalan National Civil Police Force for peacefully protesting the operations of the Fénix mine and growth of palm plantations on their territory; Whereas at least 427 environmental defenders have been reported killed in Asia since 2012, and governments in the region have also targeted environmental defenders in other manners, including—  (1) the Government of Vietnam, which has sought to silence environmental activist Dang Dinh Bach through imprisonment; (2)  the Government of the Philippines, which has enacted red-tagging campaigns to turn public sentiment against organizations like the Kalikasan People’s Network for the Environment; and (3) the Government of the People's Republic of China, which has falsely charged environmental activists Li Genshan, Zhang Baoqi, and Niu Haibo for illegally hunting or killing wildlife; Whereas the Government of Egypt hosted the 27th Conference of Parties (COP) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, while government security forces held environmental activists Ahmed Amasha and Seif Fateen in extended, arbitrary pretrial detention for joining a terrorist group after forcibly disappearing and torturing them for exercising their rights to free expression; Whereas Ali Ulvi Büyüknohutçu and Aysin Büyüknohutçu of Türkiye won lawsuits against mining companies who illegally operated pollution-creating quarries, but were shot and killed by gunmen with alleged ties to those companies; Whereas fossil fuel companies, mining operations, agribusiness plantations, and mega dams are major causes of environmental destruction and are also being used to drive communities from their homes and their lands; Whereas rampant corruption and weak rule of law enables those targeting environmental defenders to operate with impunity; and Whereas civil society is, and should be, a powerful voice for individuals experiencing and at risk from the effects of worsening climate chaos, including Indigenous Peoples whose ancestral rights, lives, traditional lands, and cultural practices are disproportionately threatened by climate chaos: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— (1) commends and expresses solidarity with environmental defenders as crucial members of civil society who defend both human rights and the environment and play a crucial role in tackling climate chaos; (2) strongly condemns the targeting, harassment, and unlawful detention of any individual or group for exercising their rights of free association and expression, including advocacy on environmental matters, reporting and seeking information on environmental violations and abuses, or cooperation with local, regional, national, or international mechanisms; (3) welcomes the relevant principles of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, done at Rio de Janeiro 1992, and United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution A/HRC/RES/40/11 (2019) as global advancements in recognizing the crucial role that environmental defenders play as human rights defenders; (4) welcomes the relevant principles of United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/76/300 (2022) as advancing the global conversation towards the importance of a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment as an international human right; (5) welcomes the United States Government’s assertion during its time as Summit Chair of the Ninth Summit of the Americas that environmental defenders should not be denied access to basic environmental information, public participation in proposed projects that would affect their communities, or justice as they seek legal redress from government authorities; (6) urges the United States Government to consult and cooperate in good faith with Indigenous Peoples who are concerned with the environment in order to obtain the free, prior, and informed consent of such Indigenous Peoples, without coercion, prior to the approval of any project affecting the lands, territories, religious practices, or other natural and cultural resources of such Indigenous Peoples; (7) welcomes the work of the Department of State-led Interagency Working Group, which invites more than 1000 officials across more than 20 Federal agencies, to reduce violence against environmental defenders and to properly monitor and address the expanding nature and cases of persecution against environmental defenders; (8) calls for the President to prioritize the global leadership of the United States in tackling reprisals against environmental defenders through a whole-of-government approach in collaboration with foreign governments, multilateral organizations, and civil society organizations; (9) urges the Department of State to integrate concerns about environmental defenders in all appropriate engagements to exert diplomatic pressure and speak out publicly in countries where environmental defenders are at risk; (10) requests that the Department of State establish a position focused on environmental defenders within the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; (11) requests that the United States Agency for International Development prioritize the finalization of an independent accountability mechanism and the establishment of a position to integrate protection of environmental defenders across broader environmental, economic growth, and human rights and democracy programming in order to better achieve its 2022–2030 Climate Strategy, which seeks to promote a safe and secure political environment at all levels of governance for Indigenous Peoples, human rights and environmental defenders, and local communities to participate in climate actions and the protection of civil society and environmental defenders, including land and resource rights for effective climate outcomes; (12) encourages the United States International Development Finance Corporation to improve transparency through its independent accountability mechanism, conduct due diligence with partners, and engage in local consultation processes based on free, prior, and informed consent; (13) encourages the United States Government to use its voice and vote within international financial institutions to ensure that United States taxpayer dollars do not support individuals, foreign governments, or private sector entities that adversely affect the environment or target or expose to harm persons who speak out against such individuals and entities; (14) encourages the United States to use its leadership in the United Nations Human Rights Council to ensure that the intergovernmental working group on transnational corporations and other business enterprises with respect to human rights that was adopted by United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution A/HRC/RES/26/9 (2014), creates an internationally legally binding instrument that supports and protects human rights defenders, including environmental defenders; (15) calls for responsible conduct of United States companies, financial institutions, and investors in relation to the freedoms and rights of Indigenous communities and other environmental defenders, particularly in the agribusiness, fossil fuel, mining, and hydroelectricity sectors; and (16) calls for the United States to use its influence as a member of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to push for the Conference of Parties to only take place in countries that have and actively encourage a thriving civil society and have taken concrete actions to tackle climate chaos, which stands in contrast to the selection of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates who were selected as hosts in 2022 and 2023, respectively.","[{'bioguideId': 'G000551', 'firstName': 'Raúl', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 (3) identification documents, including by restricting the ability to realign or correct birth certificates and other forms of identification;   Whereas the transgender community has made it clear that transgender individuals will not be erased and deserve to be accorded all of the rights and opportunities made available to all; 
 Whereas, before the creation of the United States, Indigenous two-spirit, transgender individuals existed across North America in many Native American communities, with specific terms in their own languages for these members of their communities and the social and spiritual roles they fulfilled, and while many were lost or actively suppressed by the efforts of missionaries, government agents, boarding schools, and settlers, these traditions have experienced a revival in recent decades;   Whereas transgender individuals continue to tell their stories and push for full equity under the law; 
 Whereas the civil-rights struggle has been strengthened and inspired by the leadership of the transgender community;   Whereas transgender Americans have made significant strides in elected office and political representation;

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 36 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES April 27, 2023 Mr. Allred  (for himself,  Mr. Veasey ,  Mr. Espaillat ,  Mr. Vargas , and  Mr. Torres of New York ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Foreign Affairs CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Calling for the end of impunity of unpunished Serbian sexual war crimes during the 1999 Kosovo war in the case of United States citizen and sexual war crime survivor Vasfije Krasniqi Goodman and other survivors of sexual and gender-based violence. Whereas Vasfije Krasniqi was 16 years old during the 1999 Kosovo war and living in Stanofc i Poshtem, Kosovo, then under the control of the Republic of Serbia, which was part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and led by President Slobodan Milosevic; Whereas, on April 14, 1999, a Serbian police officer entered Ms. Krasniqi’s family home in Stanofc i Poshtem, Kosovo, looking for all male occupants, and ordered Ms. Krasniqi to go to the police station to give a statement about her father and brothers, who were not present; Whereas the Serbian police officer threatened to shoot everyone present, including Ms. Krasniqi and her mother, before forcibly removing Ms. Krasniqi from the house and taking her to a Serbian village nearby; Whereas the Serbian police officer forced Ms. Krasniqi into an empty house off the main road and threw her onto dried corn stacks before taking her to his car, where he started raping her despite her yelling and screams for him to stop; Whereas Ms. Krasniqi was held at gunpoint and raped repeatedly before losing consciousness; Whereas, once Ms. Krasniqi regained consciousness, she begged the Serbian police officer to kill her, and the Serbian police officer responded by saying,  No, I won’t because you will suffer more this way , and threatened to take her to an area full of Serbian forces where more people would rape her; Whereas the Serbian police officer later went into a local store in the same village, from where an older, crippled Serbian man emerged and forced Ms. Krasniqi out of the car and took her to an unfinished house where he raped her; Whereas, a few hours later, Ms. Krasniqi was taken back to her village where she was left out on the street and told not to tell anyone about what had transpired; Whereas Ms. Krasniqi did not want to go home having to explain to anyone what had happened to her, but instead walked through the village cemetery and hoped that her life would come to an end then and there; Whereas, upon arriving at her uncle’s house hours after the assault, Ms. Krasniqi did not have to say a word, as everyone knew what had happened, witnessing her scratches, bruises, cuts, and torn clothes; Whereas Ms. Krasniqi reported her case to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) the day after she was raped on April 15, 1999; Whereas, in March 1999, with the support of the United States, NATO began a 78-day air campaign against Serbian forces in Kosovo after efforts to negotiate an end to the Kosovo war collapsed, leading to Serbia’s agreement to cease all military activity in Kosovo and to facilitate the withdrawal of Serbian forces from Kosovo, and the deployment of a NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR); Whereas the United Nations Security Council then passed Resolution 1244 on June 10, 1999, which established the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) as a temporary government until Kosovo’s own institutions had developed and demonstrated the capacity to self-govern, which included various powers, such as the authority to administer justice in Kosovo and the ability to investigate and prosecute serious crimes committed during the war; Whereas Ms. Krasniqi reported her case to UNMIK on September 10, 1999, with no outcome, as well as to the French KFOR on April 21, 2004, but inaction of both these bodies caused additional difficulties and delays in her case; Whereas Kosovo declared independence on February 17, 2008, and has since received the recognition of over 100 states, including the United States and 23 of the 28 European Union member states, though Serbia still rejects such claim; Whereas the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) was launched in 2008 as a civilian mission to support rule-of-law institutions, accountability, and compliance with international human rights standards in Kosovo within the framework of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, as well as to support the Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor’s Office in line with relevant Kosovo legislation; Whereas Ms. Krasniqi moved to the United States in 2001, naturalized as a citizen in 2006, and now lives in Rowlett, Texas, with her husband and two children, each of whom are also United States citizens, and she has also taken the last name Goodman; Whereas Ms. Krasniqi Goodman reported her case to EULEX authorities and gave five interviews from August 2010 to July 2012, and witnesses gave several testimonies from February 2011 to August 2012; Whereas, on November 12, 2012, the Special Prosecution Office of the Republic of Kosovo (SPRK) filed the indictment PPS nr. 89/2012 against the perpetrators Jovica Dejanovic (DOB 09/11/1954), the Serbian police officer, and Djordje Bojkovic (DOB 11/13/1940), the older and crippled Serbian man, with the then-District Court of Mitrovica, which was amended on November 30, 2012; Whereas the main trial was held between April 4 to 15, 2013, and on April 17, 2013, the Basic Court of Mitrovica announced the judgment that both perpetrators were acquitted of the charge of war crime against the civilian population (rape), punishable under Articles 22 and 142 CC SFRY; Whereas, on October 31, 2013, the SPRK Prosecutors submitted a joint appeal proposing that the judgment of the first instance court be modified and Jovica Dejanovic and Djordje Bojkovic be convicted of the criminal offense of war crime against civilian population, or in the alternative, to return the case to the court of first instance for a retrial; Whereas the Appellate Public Prosecutor moved the Court of Appeals to grant the appeal of the Special Prosecutors, and the Court of Appeals rendered its judgment on May 27, 2014, and found both Jovica Dejanovic and Djordje Bojkovic guilty and convicted them of the war crime against civilians under Article 142 CC SFRY (now Article 153 CCRK), sentencing them to 12 years and 10 years of imprisonment, respectively; Whereas, on July 2014, Jovica Dejanovic and Djordje Bojkovic filed their appeals against the judgment of the Court of Appeals PaKr 503/13 dated May 27, 2014, and the Supreme Court of Kosovo rendered a ruling for the immediate release of Jovica Dejanovic and Djordje Bojkovic from the detention on remand; Whereas Jovica Dejanovic and Djordje Bojkovic were released, and nobody has been held responsible for the sexual war crimes committed against Vasfije Krasniqi Goodman; Whereas all prior mechanisms for pursuing accountability for war crimes in Kosovo have fallen short in bringing perpetrators of sexual violence to justice, including the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, UNMIK, EULEX, and the Kosovo judicial system; Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that approximately 20,000 individuals were the victims of conflict-related sexual violence during the Kosovo war, and Human Rights Watch reports that rape was used as a weapon of war and instrument of ethnic cleansing by Serbian forces during the Kosovo war; Whereas 20 years later and after approximately 20,000 individuals raped, there has only been one perpetrator brought to justice, Zoran Vukotic, by the Prishtina Basic Court on July 5, 2021; Whereas the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820 was unanimously adopted on June 19, 2008, condemning the use of sexual violence as a tool of war, and declared that  rape and other forms of sexual violence can constitute war crimes, crimes against humanity or a constitutive act with respect to genocide ; Whereas the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2467 was adopted on April 23, 2019,  recalling the responsibilities of States to end impunity and to prosecute those responsible for crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, perpetrated against civilians ;  Whereas Vasfije Krasniqi Goodman testified before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives on April 30, 2019, in a hearing titled  Kosovo’s Wartime Victims: The Quest for Justice , testifying for justice on behalf of her case and the 20,000 individuals raped during the Kosovo war; Whereas the Republic of Kosovo marked for the first time on April 14, 2023, the Day of Survivors of Sexual Violence During the War in Kosovo that coincides with the date Vasfije Krasniqi Goodman was abducted by Serbian police and subsequently sexually assaulted; and Whereas the United States recognizes that preventing and responding to gender-based violence around the world is not only a matter of human rights, justice, equity, and equality, but is also a moral imperative and the strategic national interest of the United States and its global partners: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— (1) finds it reprehensible that no individuals have been found guilty for the sexual war crimes against Ms. Krasniqi Goodman; (2) strongly condemns the use of rape and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence as a weapon of war; (3) underscores the importance of transparent, accountable, and independent investigations into gender-based war crimes and atrocities; (4) commends the Government of the Republic of Kosovo for taking a tangible and multisectoral approach to address the sexual violence during the war in the country; (5) calls on the Government of the Republic of Kosovo to uphold commitments expressed and agreed to in the  Protocol for the Treatment of Sexual Violence Cases in Kosovo , and prioritize and expedite cases of rape and sexual assault from the 1999 Kosovo War; (6) calls on the Government of the Republic of Serbia to— (A) bring individuals who are responsible for the sexual war crimes on April 14, 1999, of United States citizen Vasfije Krasniqi Goodman in Kosovo before justice pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1820 and 2467; (B) cease the protection and glorification of any individuals who were involved in war crimes during the Kosovo conflict and make it a priority to investigate and prosecute any such individuals; (C) enforce laws to ensure that known perpetrators of sexual gender-based violence are held accountable and are brought before justice; and (D) prioritize the creation and sustainment of appropriate tracking and investigative mechanisms to extradite known perpetrators and convicted offenders of sexual gender-based violence during the Kosovo war in 1999 to Kosovo to be brought to justice according to all conventions; and (7) calls on the United States Government to— (A) uphold and strengthen its commitments to counter and prevent the practice of gender-based violence in accordance with the  United States Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based Violence Globally ; (B) elevate the case of Vasfije Krasniqi Goodman in future bilateral engagements with the Government of Serbia, especially in terms of accountability for war crimes committed against women and youth; (C) identify the specific factors that increase the risks of gender-based violence and undermine access to services and safety; (D) monitor efforts by the Government of Serbia and its relevant ministries and offices to investigate and prosecute cases of sexual violence during the Kosovo war;

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 37 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES May 2, 2023 Mr. Blumenauer  (for himself,  Ms. Ocasio-Cortez ,  Ms. Lee of California ,  Ms. Barragán ,  Ms. Blunt Rochester ,  Ms. Bonamici ,  Mr. Bowman ,  Mr. Casar ,  Ms. Chu ,  Ms. Clarke of New York ,  Mr. Cleaver ,  Mr. Cohen ,  Mr. Doggett ,  Mr. Espaillat ,  Mr. Evans ,  Mr. Gomez ,  Ms. Norton ,  Ms. Hoyle of Oregon ,  Mr. Huffman ,  Ms. Jayapal ,  Ms. Kamlager-Dove ,  Mr. Krishnamoorthi ,  Mr. Lieu ,  Ms. Meng ,  Mrs. Napolitano ,  Ms. Omar ,  Ms. Pingree ,  Mr. Pocan ,  Ms. Porter ,  Mr. Quigley ,  Mr. Raskin ,  Ms. Salinas ,  Ms. Schakowsky ,  Mr. Schiff ,  Ms. Stansbury ,  Ms. Tlaib ,  Ms. Tokuda ,  Mr. Tonko ,  Ms. Velázquez ,  Mrs. Watson Coleman ,  Mr. Nadler ,  Mr. Frost ,  Ms. Bush ,  Mr. García of Illinois ,  Ms. Brownley ,  Mr. Vargas ,  Ms. Escobar ,  Mr. Takano ,  Mr. Khanna ,  Mr. Grijalva ,  Ms. Wilson of Florida ,  Mr. Johnson of Georgia ,  Mrs. Hayes ,  Mr. Beyer ,  Ms. Balint ,  Ms. Lofgren ,  Mr. Panetta ,  Ms. Jacobs ,  Mr. McGovern ,  Mr. Cárdenas ,  Mr. Ryan ,  Ms. Williams of Georgia , and  Mr. Lynch ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Energy and Commerce CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Expressing the sense of Congress that there is a climate emergency which demands a massive-scale mobilization to halt, reverse, and address its consequences and causes. Whereas the 8 warmest years on record have now occurred since 2014, with 2016 as the hottest year recorded, and each of the past 4 decades have been warmer than the preceding decade; Whereas global atmospheric concentrations of the primary global warming pollutant, carbon dioxide— (1) have increased, primarily due to human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, by 40 percent since preindustrial times, from 280 parts per million to 415 parts per million; (2) are rising at a rate of 2 to 3 parts per million annually; and (3) must be reduced to not more than 350 parts per million, and likely lower,  if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted,  according to former National Aeronautics and Space Administration climatologist Dr. James Hansen; Whereas global atmospheric concentrations of other global warming pollutants, including methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons, have also increased substantially since preindustrial times, primarily due to human activities, including the burning of fossil fuels; Whereas climate science and observations of climate change impacts, including ocean warming, ocean acidification, floods, droughts, wildfires, and extreme weather, demonstrate that a global rise in concentrations of global warming pollutants is already having dangerous impacts on human populations and the environment; Whereas with the current 1.1 degrees Celsius of warming above preindustrial levels, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration finds that climate change is already increasing the frequency of extreme weather and other climate-related disasters, including drought, wildfire, and storms that include precipitation; Whereas the overall costs for such disasters for the United States in 2022 was roughly $165 billion, the third highest recorded total costs, including 18 separate weather and climate disasters costing at least 1 billion dollars each and caused at least 474 direct or indirect known fatalities; Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds there are wide-ranging, acute, and fatal public health consequences from climate change that impact communities across the United States; Whereas, according to the National Climate and Health Assessment of the United States Global Change Research Program, climate change is a significant threat to the health of the people of the United States, leading to increased— (1) temperature-related deaths and illnesses; (2) air quality impacts; (3) extreme weather events; (4) numbers of vector-borne diseases; (5) waterborne illnesses; (6) food safety, nutrition, and distribution complications; and (7) mental health and well-being concerns; Whereas environmental and public health threats from climate change and climate disasters are not randomly distributed and disproportionately affect low-income communities and communities of color; Whereas the consequences of climate change are felt most severely by frontline communities and endanger populations made especially vulnerable by existing exposure to extreme weather events, such as children, the elderly, and individuals with preexisting disabilities and health conditions; Whereas individuals and families on the frontlines of climate change across the United States, including territories, living with income inequality and poverty, institutional racism, inequity on the basis of gender and sexual orientation, poor infrastructure, and lack of access to health care, housing, clean water, and food security are often in close proximity to environmental stressors or sources of pollution, particularly communities of color, indigenous communities, and low-income communities, which— (1) are often the first exposed to the impacts of climate change; (2) experience outsized risk because of the close proximity of the community to environmental hazards and stressors, in addition to collocation with waste and other sources of pollution; and (3) have the fewest resources to mitigate those impacts or to relocate, which will exacerbate preexisting challenges; Whereas climate change holds grave and immediate consequences not just for the population of the United States, including territories, but for communities across the world, particularly those communities in the Global South on the front lines of the climate crisis that are at risk of forced displacement; Whereas the Department of State, the Department of Defense, and the intelligence community have identified climate change as a threat to national security, and the Department of Homeland Security views climate change as a top national security risk; Whereas the climatic changes resulting from global warming above 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, including changes resulting from global warming of more than 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, are projected to result in irreversible, catastrophic changes to public health, livelihoods, quality of life, food security, water supplies, human security, and economic growth; Whereas even with global warming up to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, the planet is projected to experience— (1) a significant rise in sea levels; (2) extraordinary loss of biodiversity; and (3) intensifying droughts, floods, wildfires, and other extreme weather events; Whereas, according to climate scientists, addressing the climate emergency will require a just phase-out of the use of oil, gas, and coal in order to keep the carbon that is the primary constituent of fossil fuels in the ground and out of the atmosphere; Whereas in 2022 some of the world’s largest oil and gas companies reported record annual profits and rewarded shareholders with buybacks while knowingly exacerbating the ongoing climate crisis; Whereas the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has determined that limiting warming through emissions reduction and carbon sequestration will require rapid and immediate acceleration and proliferation of  far-reaching, multilevel, and cross-sectoral climate mitigation  and  transitions in energy, land, urban and rural infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems ; Whereas, in August 2022, the United States took its single most aggressive action to tackle the climate crisis and transition to create renewable energy solutions when the Inflation Reduction Act (in this resolution referred to as the  IRA ) was signed into law by President Biden; Whereas the IRA includes $369 billion for energy security and climate change, including investments in disadvantaged communities, projects that repurpose retired fossil fuel infrastructure and employ displaced workers, and setting the United States on course for a renewable energy transition as soon as possible; Whereas the IRA creates new environmental justice block grants, establishes renewable energy financing, provides funding for Tribal communities to boost climate resilience, makes it more affordable to purchase energy efficient and electric appliances, incentivizes domestic manufacturing of renewable energy technologies, and will boost the renewable energy economy; Whereas the passage of the IRA is projected to reduce the United States global warming emissions between 31 percent to 44 percent below 2005 levels by 2030; Whereas the UN Environment Programme still found in October 2022 that the existing commitments made in the Nationally Determined Contributions since the 2015 Paris Climate Conference are insufficient to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius; Whereas urgent governmental action is still required to address the severe environmental, economic, social, public health, and national security threats posed by the climate crisis; Whereas the massive scope and scale of action necessary to stabilize the climate will continue to require unprecedented levels of public awareness, engagement, and deliberation to develop and implement effective, just, and equitable policies to address the climate crisis; Whereas the United States has a proud history of collaborative, constructive, massive-scale Federal mobilizations of resources and labor in order to solve great challenges, such as the Interstate Highway System, the Apollo 11 Moon landing, Reconstruction, the New Deal, and World War II; Whereas the Constitution of the United States protects the fundamental rights to life, liberty, property, and equal protection of the laws, and a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society as well as the preservation of our fundamental rights; Whereas 18 national governments across the world and the European Union have declared a climate emergency, as well as the State of Hawaii and more than 190 other cities, counties, and local jurisdictions in the United States; Whereas the United States maintains existing resources and international commitments for bilateral and multilateral assistance to support economically emerging countries, including the Green Climate Fund, the Clean Technology Fund, the Adaptation Fund, the Least Developed Countries Fund, and the International Sustainable Landscapes programs, that should be supported with robust funding levels; Whereas President Biden also maintains existing Executive authority under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Mineral Leasing Act, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act, the Clean Water Act, the Natural Gas Act, and the Clean Air Act that can be used to address the ongoing climate crisis; Whereas, under these existing authorities, the President can phase down the rate of fossil fuel production on federal lands and in federal waters, limit gas exports, halt approval of new fossil fuel infrastructure projects, establish national limits for greenhouse gases, and decarbonize transportation;  Whereas a national climate emergency declaration would further unlock the broad powers of the National Emergency Act, the Defense Production Act, and the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act; Whereas such a declaration can be used to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions, address environmental injustice, invest in large scale mitigation and resiliency projects, create additional jobs with family sustaining wages and benefits, and ensure a just transition to a renewable energy economy; Whereas such a declaration will allow the United States to further mobilize domestic industry, ramp up domestic manufacturing of renewable energy technologies, and deploy resilient energy infrastructure; Whereas such a declaration can also reinstate the ban on crude oil exports, suspend offshore fossil fuel leases, curb fossil fuel imports, and stop the hundreds of billions of dollars in investments in fossil fuel projects abroad while taking additional steps toward strengthening our emergency preparedness for thousands of high-risk communities; Whereas such a declaration necessitates the adoption of policies and processes rooted in principles of racial equity, self-determination, and democracy, as well as the fundamental human rights of all people to clean air and water, healthy food, adequate land, education, and shelter, as promulgated in the 1991 Principles of Environmental Justice; Whereas front-line communities, Tribal Governments and communities, people of color, and labor unions must be equitably and actively engaged in a national climate emergency declaration, in such a way that aligns with the 1996 Jemez Principles of Democratic Organizing, and prioritized through local climate mitigation and adaptation planning, policy, and program delivery so that workers in the United States, and the communities of those workers, are guaranteed a strong, viable economic future; and Whereas the United States has an obligation, as a primary driver of accelerated climate change, to mobilize at emergency speed to ensure the safest climate and environment possible not just for communities of the United States but for communities across the world, particularly those on the front lines of the climate crisis which have least contributed to the crisis, and to account for global and community impacts of any actions it takes in response to the climate crisis: Now, therefore, be it That it is the sense of Congress that– (1) climate change caused by human activities, which increase emissions of greenhouse gases, constitutes a climate emergency that— (A) severely and urgently impacts the economic and social well-being, health, safety, and national security of the United States; and (B) demands that the President wield both existing authorities and emergency powers to ensure a national, social, industrial, and economic mobilization of the resources and labor of the United States at a massive scale to mitigate and prepare for the consequences of the climate emergency for current and future generations; and (2) nothing in this concurrent resolution constitutes a declaration of a national emergency for the purposes of any Act of Congress authorizing the exercise, during the period of a national emergency or other type of declared emergency, of any special or extraordinary power.","[{'bioguideId': 'B000574', 'firstName': 'EARL', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 38 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES May 2, 2023 Mr. LaLota  submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Foreign Affairs CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Expressing the sense of Congress regarding the execution-style murders of United States citizens Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi in the Republic of Serbia in July 1999. Whereas brothers Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi were citizens of the United States, born in Chicago, Illinois, to ethnic Albanian parents from what is today the Republic of Kosovo, and who subsequently lived in Hampton Bays, New York; Whereas the three Bytyqi brothers responded to the brutality of the conflict associated with Kosovo’s separation from the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of which Serbia was a constituent republic by joining the so-called  Atlantic Brigade  of the Kosovo Liberation Army in April 1999; Whereas a Military-Technical Agreement between the Government of Yugoslavia and the North Atlantic Council came into effect on June 10, 1999, leading to a cessation of hostilities; Whereas the Bytyqi brothers were arrested on June 23, 1999, by Serbian police within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia when the brothers accidently crossed what was then an unmarked administrative border while escorting an ethnic Romani family who had been neighbors to safety outside Kosovo; Whereas the Bytyqi brothers were jailed for 15 days for illegal entry into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in Prokuplje, Serbia, until a judge ordered their release on July 8, 1999; Whereas, instead of being released, the Bytyqi brothers were taken by a special operations unit of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs to a training facility near Petrovo Selo, Serbia, where all three were executed; Whereas, at the time of their murders, Ylli was 25, Agron was 23, and Mehmet was 21 years of age; Whereas Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was removed from office on October 5, 2000, following massive demonstrations protesting his refusal to acknowledge and accept election results the month before; Whereas, in the following years, the political leadership of Serbia has worked to strengthen democratic institutions, to develop stronger adherence to the rule of law, and to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia evolved into a State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in February 2003, which itself dissolved when both republics proclaimed their respective independence in June 2006; Whereas the United States Embassy in Belgrade, Serbia, was informed on July 17, 2001, that the bodies of Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi were found with their hands bound and gunshot wounds to the back of their heads, buried atop an earlier mass grave of approximately 70 bodies of murdered civilians from Kosovo; Whereas Serbian authorities subsequently investigated but never charged those individuals who were part of the Ministry of Internal Affairs chain of command related to this crime, including former Minister of Internal Affairs Vlajko Stojilkovic, Assistant Minister and Chief of the Public Security Department Vlastimir Djordjevic, and special operations training camp commander Goran  Guri  Radosavljevic; Whereas Vlajko Stojilkovic died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in April 2002 prior to being transferred to the custody of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia where he had been charged with crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war during the Kosovo conflict; Whereas Vlastimir Djordjevic was arrested and transferred to the custody of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in June 2007, and sentenced in February 2011 to 27 years imprisonment (later reduced to 18 years) for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war committed during the Kosovo conflict; Whereas Goran  Guri  Radosavljevic is reported to reside in Serbia, working as director of a security consulting firm in Belgrade, and is a prominent member of the governing political party; Whereas the Secretary of State designated Goran Radosavljevic of Serbia under section 7031(c) of the Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2018 as ineligible for entry into the United States due to his involvement in gross violations of human rights; Whereas two Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs officers, Sretan Popovic and Milos Stojanovic, were charged in 2006 for crimes associated with their involvement in the detention and transport of the Bytyqi brothers from Prokuplje to Petrovo Selo, but acquitted in May 2012 with an appeals court confirming the verdict in March 2013; Whereas the Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic promised several high ranking United States officials to deliver justice in the cases of the deaths of Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi; Whereas no individual has ever been found guilty for the murders of Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi or of any other crimes associated with their deaths; and Whereas no individual is currently facing criminal charges regarding the murder of the Bytyqi brothers despite many promises by Serbian officials to resolve the case: Now, therefore, be it That it is the sense of Congress that— (1) those individuals responsible for the murders in July 1999 of United States citizens Ylli, Agron, and Mehmet Bytyqi in Serbia should be brought to justice; (2) it is reprehensible that no individual has ever been found guilty for executing the Bytyqi brothers, or of any other crimes associated with their deaths, and that no individual is even facing charges for these horrible crimes; (3) the Government of Serbia and its relevant ministries and offices, including the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor’s Office, should make it a priority to investigate and prosecute as soon as possible those current or former officials believed to be responsible for their deaths, directly or indirectly; (4) the United States should devote sufficient resources to fully assist and properly monitor efforts by the Government of Serbia and its relevant ministries and offices to investigate and prosecute as soon as possible those individuals believed to be responsible for their deaths, directly or indirectly; and (5) progress in resolving this case, or the lack thereof, should remain a significant factor determining the further development of relations between the United States and the Republic of Serbia.","[{'bioguideId': 'L000598', 'firstName': 'Nick', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 39 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES May 2, 2023 Ms. Williams of Georgia  (for herself,  Mr. Espaillat ,  Ms. Tlaib ,  Ms. Lee of California ,  Mr. García of Illinois ,  Ms. Crockett ,  Ms. Schakowsky ,  Ms. Barragán ,  Mr. McGovern ,  Ms. Escobar ,  Mr. Grijalva ,  Ms. Wasserman Schultz ,  Mr. Castro of Texas ,  Ms. Kamlager-Dove ,  Mr. Payne ,  Ms. Sánchez , and  Ms. Velázquez ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Foreign Affairs , and in addition to the Committee on  Energy and Commerce , for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Expressing the sense of Congress to support the case of Beatriz, a young woman from a rural area of El Salvador, living in extreme poverty and with lupus, who fought for her life against the state to allow her to terminate a pregnancy that put her at risk, which exposed the serious consequences of the absolute criminalization of abortion in El Salvador, and urging the Salvadoran state to assume its international obligations in the field of human rights. Whereas, in March 2013, Beatriz, a young woman living in poverty with lupus, was told she was 11 weeks pregnant with a high-risk pregnancy; Whereas Beatriz’s pregnancy was found to be unviable given the diagnosis of anencephaly; Whereas medical staff agreed that Beatriz’s pregnancy had to be terminated due to Beatriz’s deteriorating health and life endangerment; Whereas the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice denied Beatriz’s petition to provide her lifesaving abortion care and necessitated the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to intervene and grant temporary precautionary measures in Beatriz’s favor on April 29, 2013, and the Inter-American Court of Human Rights issued a similar order on May 29, 2013; Whereas, on June 3, 2013, Beatriz underwent a cesarean section, and the anencephalic fetus died 5 hours later; Whereas Beatriz was denied access to a legal, early, and timely abortion in a case of an anencephalic pregnancy, which not only damaged her health, personal integrity, and life, but also violated the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, and her right to live a life free from violence and discrimination as is stated in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; Whereas the United States has joined the international community in identifying reproductive rights as human rights, including in connection with the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development, the 1995 Beijing World Conference on Women, and through its ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in New York, on December 19, 1966, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination in New York, on December 21, 1965, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in New York, on December 10, 1984; Whereas General Comment No. 36 (2018) on article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which was adopted by the Human Rights Committee on October 30, 2018, asserts that states’ parties— (1) should ensure access for all persons to  quality and evidence-based information and education about sexual and reproductive health and to a wide range of affordable contraceptive methods ; (2) must provide safe, legal, and effective access to abortion where the life and health of the pregnant woman or girl is at risk, or where carrying a pregnancy to term would cause the pregnant woman or girl substantial pain or suffering, most notably where pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or is not viable ; (3) ensure the availability of, and effective access to, quality prenatal and post-abortion health care for women and girls ; and (4) must not impose restrictions on the ability of women or girls to seek abortion in a manner that jeopardizes their lives, subjects them to physical or mental pain or suffering, discriminates against them, arbitrarily interferes with their privacy, or places them at risk of undertaking unsafe abortions; Whereas United Nations treaty-monitoring bodies established that abortion restrictions violate human rights, including the rights to life, health, and privacy, and the right to equality and nondiscrimination or freedom from torture and ill-treatment, among others; Whereas United Nations treaty-monitoring bodies have repeatedly recognized the connection between restrictive laws on abortion and maternal mortality due to unsafe abortion; Whereas access to the full range of sexual, gender-affirming, and reproductive health care, including abortion, is essential to the health and well-being of all people; Whereas reproductive and sexual health care providers administer high-quality, essential health care, and play a critical role in ensuring people are able to make decisions about their bodies and lives with dignity, empathy, compassion, and respect; Whereas no one should be criminalized for any pregnancy outcome; Whereas no one should be criminalized for providing essential health care; Whereas the threat of criminalization or prosecution can result in negative outcomes by intimidating people from seeking or providing care; Whereas health care providers have an ethical obligation to provide essential care to their patients and to protect the private medical information integral to the patient-provider relationship; Whereas Indigenous people, Afro-descendant people, people of color, people with low incomes, people living in rural areas, people with disabilities, migrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other marginalized individuals are disproportionately likely to be surveilled, arrested, charged, prosecuted, convicted, and heavily punished within the criminal justice system; Whereas Indigenous people, Afro-descendant people, people of color, people with low incomes, people living in rural areas, people with disabilities, migrants, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other marginalized individuals are more likely, due to persistent disparities, to experience adverse pregnancy outcomes that place them under the scrutiny of the legal system; Whereas limiting access to sexual and reproductive health and rights, including access to abortion, also limits pathways to economic, social, and political empowerment; Whereas sexual and reproductive health and rights are intrinsically linked to gender justice and improved health outcomes for women and their children; Whereas abortion is recognized as essential public health care as determined by the World Health Organization (WHO); Whereas self-managed abortion is a safe and scientifically documented health service that can be performed without the participation of medical professionals to increase access in the most remote locations; Whereas the most recent WHO abortion guidelines recommend the full decriminalization of abortion, the removal of grounds-based restrictions on abortion, and gestational age limits on abortion provision, and include self-managed abortion among the WHO-recommended methods and models of care; Whereas reproductive coercion, which is any behavior that interferes with autonomous decision making about reproductive health outcomes, is a violation of human rights; Whereas the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision has decimated abortion access in the United States, and cases like Beatriz’s are being seen across many of the States that have banned or severely restricted abortion access, including a recent lawsuit brought by 5 women and 2 obstetricians and gynecologists against the State of Texas after the women were denied abortion care even though they were facing severe and dangerous pregnancy complications and even though the women’s conditions should have qualified under the State’s abortion ban exceptions, and as a result of the denials, their conditions worsened, posing great risks to their fertility, health, and lives; Whereas the United States Department of State included in its 2021 Country Report on Human Rights Practices for El Salvador reports of discrimination, wrongful incarceration, abuse, and mistreatment of women who suffered pregnancy complications and miscarriages, and acknowledged the Inter-American Court of Human Rights’ 2021 ruling in Manuela v. El Salvador that the government violated the right to personal freedom, life, health, and justice in the case of Manuela, a woman sentenced to 30 years in prison after suffering a pregnancy loss; and Whereas punishing people for their pregnancy outcomes or for providing essential reproductive and sexual health care violates their human rights: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— (1) condemns the absolute criminalization of abortion in El Salvador and anywhere in the world; (2) affirms that all people deserve access to high-quality health care without fear of reprisal or punishment; (3) calls upon the Inter-American Court of Human Rights to recognize that total criminalization of abortion violates the rights to life, health (including mental health), freedom from torture, and information; and (4) urges States that still have a total ban on abortion to decriminalize abortion and protect and guarantee human rights.","[{'bioguideId': 'W000788', 'firstName': 'Nikema', 'fullName': 'Rep.

Whereas law enforcement officers protect the American people from criminals who seek to perpetrate violence and harm innocent lives regardless of the political circumstances of the day; Whereas the brave men and women of the law enforcement community continually summon the courage to fulfill their solemn oath to ensure the safety of our communities and provide peace of mind for our Nation’s citizens; Whereas America’s law enforcement community also seeks to assist the communities they serve through a variety of nontraditional means, including nonarrest pathways that connect individuals with treatment and recovery programs to overcome addiction, and juvenile diversion programs to prevent minors from entering the criminal justice system; Whereas supporting law enforcement officers with the equipment, training, and funding necessary to serve our communities and keep our streets safe has long been a bipartisan issue; Whereas law enforcement officers willingly face dangerous circumstances and the threat of serious bodily injury or death on a daily basis to ensure the safety of all Americans; Whereas the National Law Enforcement Memorial and Museum’s 2021 Law Enforcement Officers Fatalities Report detailed that 458 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty in 2021, an increase of 55 percent from the previous year, including 62 officers who were killed in firearms-related incidents; Whereas protests have been hijacked by violent extremists seeking to sow discord, damage property, loot businesses, and inflict harm against civilians and law enforcement officers; Whereas law enforcement officers have been run over, shot, hit with objects, and stabbed attempting to maintain peace and the rule of law; Whereas progressive politicians and interest groups have responded to this violence with calls to defund law enforcement agencies across the Nation; Whereas defunding or otherwise handcuffing law enforcement officers will make officers less likely to intervene in dangerous situations and will result in law enforcement pulling back from the neighborhoods they are entrusted to protect; Whereas violent crime increases when law enforcement is forced to withdraw from neighborhoods; Whereas the vilification of the Nation’s law enforcement officers and the embracing of hateful rhetoric against these brave men and women only places them further in harm’s way; Whereas these brave men and women must operate in an environment where their moral and legal authority is constantly being scrutinized, and they undertake the critical yet difficult task of addressing the actions of those affected by addiction, homelessness, and mental illness; and Whereas efforts to defund police departments will cause irreparable and lasting damage to the Nation: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— (1) offers its sincere gratitude and appreciation to the Nation’s law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities;  (2) recognizes the great sacrifice our law enforcement officers make to keep the Nation safe; and (3) rejects the misguided and dangerous efforts to defund and dismantle the Nation’s law enforcement agencies.","[{'bioguideId': 'B001297', 'firstName': 'Ken', 'fullName': 'Rep.

Whereas our brave men and women in local law enforcement work tirelessly to protect the communities they serve; Whereas local law enforcement officers are tasked with upholding the rule of law and ensuring public safety; Whereas local law enforcement officers selflessly put themselves in harm’s way to fight crime, get drugs off our streets, and protect the innocent; Whereas, in the summer of 2020, looting, rioting, and violence in major cities caused the destruction of many shops, restaurants, and businesses; Whereas, in 2020, the United States tallied more than 21,000 murders—the highest total since 1995 and 4,900 more than in 2019; Whereas leftist activists and progressive politicians called for the defunding and dismantling of local police departments across the country and actively encouraged resentment toward local law enforcement; Whereas the defund the police movement vilifies and demonizes local law enforcement officers and puts them at greater risk of danger; Whereas many local jurisdictions defunded their police departments and saw a subsequent increase in violent crime; Whereas calls to  defund ,  disband ,  dismantle , or  abolish  the police should be condemned and rule of law should be strictly maintained; Whereas local law enforcement officers take an oath to never betray the public trust; Whereas in the course of investigations into officers who have allegedly exhibited misconduct, local law enforcement should have certain rights to ensure a fair administration of justice, including—  (1) a local law enforcement officer’s inherent right to self-defense against physical threats;  (2) a local law enforcement officer’s right to legal recourse if a civilian attempts to assault the local law enforcement officer;  (3) a local law enforcement officer’s right to be protected from physical harassment targeting a local law enforcement officer;  (4) a local law enforcement officer’s right to equipment necessary for personal protection;  (5) a local law enforcement officer’s right to counsel or a representative present at any interview conducted as part of an investigation;  (6) a local law enforcement officer’s right to be informed of the nature of the investigation before any interview commences, including the name of the complainant and sufficient information to reasonably apprise the officer of the allegations;  (7) during questioning in the course of an investigation a local law enforcement officer’s right—  (A) to not be subjected to any offensive language;  (B) to not be threatened with departmental, civil, or criminal charges; and  (C) to not receive financial or promotional inducement;  (8) a local law enforcement officer’s right to a hearing, with notification in advance of the date, access to transcripts, other relevant documents, and evidence;  (9) a local law enforcement officer’s right to have the opportunity to respond to adverse accusations; and  (10) a local law enforcement officer’s right to not be disciplined for exercising a Fifth Amendment right to remain silent unless granted immunity that such statements will not be used against the officer in any criminal proceeding;  Whereas in order to ensure these investigations are conducted in a manner that protects the public, respects the rights of local law enforcement personnel, and is conducive to good order and discipline;  Whereas States across the country are encouraged to adopt a  Bill of Rights  for local law enforcement personnel for protections related to investigation and prosecution arising from conduct during official performance of duties;  Whereas the local law enforcement community protects our streets, acknowledges the rights of all Americans, and keeps citizens safe from harm;  Whereas local law enforcement officers are recognized for their public service to all, knowing they face extremely dangerous situations while carrying out their duties;  Whereas a healthy and collaborative relationship between local law enforcement officers and the communities they serve is essential to creating mutually respectful dialogue;  Whereas violent leftist extremists have repeatedly attacked and assaulted local law enforcement officers; and Whereas local law enforcement officers deserve our respect and profound gratitude: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— (1) recognizes and appreciates the dedication and devotion demonstrated by the men and women of local law enforcement who keep our communities safe; and  (2) condemns calls to defund, disband, dismantle, or abolish the police. Passed the House of Representatives May 18, 2023. Cheryl L. Johnson, Clerk.","[{'bioguideId': 'B001297', 'firstName': 'Ken', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 Whereas open water lifeguards perform an essential function of protecting countless lives from death or serious injury;   Whereas these lifeguards do so at great risk to their own lives; 
 Whereas, in 2021, two lifeguards in the State of New Jersey lost their lives while performing their duty;   Whereas many open water lifeguards are cross-trained in emergency medical response, marine fire safety, law enforcement, and water rescue craft operations; 
 Whereas lifeguards respond and attend to victims, treat victims, assist victims, and transport victims, the 4 defined duties of a emergency response employee;   Whereas lifeguards not only protect life, but also property, evidence, and the environment, the 4 tenets which define a first responder; 
 Whereas United States law already recognizes open water lifeguards as first responders or emergency response providers;   Whereas many other countries recognize lifeguards as emergency responders, and grant them access to the programs to which first responders are entitled; and 
 Whereas, during the COVID–19 emergency, open water lifeguards ought to have been considered  essential workers  and given priority access to vaccinations: Now, therefore, be it   That Congress reaffirms that open water lifeguards qualify as first responders and emergency response providers, and recognizes the essential, lifesaving work performed by these brave individuals.","[{'bioguideId': 'S000522', 'firstName': 'CHRISTOPHER', 'fullName': 'Rep.

Whereas Mary Eliza Mahoney was born May 7, 1845, in Dorchester, Massachusetts, to Charles Mahoney and Mary Jane Seward Mahoney-freed, formerly enslaved persons who had moved to Boston from North Carolina; Whereas Mary Eliza Mahoney, at the age of 33, was accepted as a student nurse at the hospital-based program of nursing at the New England Hospital for Women and Children; Whereas Mary Eliza Mahoney was 1 of 4 students, of a class of 42, who completed nursing at the New England Hospital for Women and Children in 1879; Whereas Mary Eliza Mahoney devoted her time and efforts unselfishly to the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses and was installed as the Official Chaplin; Whereas Mary Eliza Mahoney’s motto was,  Work more and better the coming year than the previous year. ; Whereas Mary Eliza Mahoney delivered the first annual keynote speech of the National Association of Colored Graduate Nurses and established the Mary Eliza Award, which today continues as the Mary Eliza Mahoney Award bestowed biennially by the American Nurses Association; Whereas Mary Eliza Mahoney supported the suffrage movement and was the first Black professionally trained nurse to receive retirement benefits from a fund left by a Boston physician to care for 60 nurses, who received 25 dollars every 3 months as long as they lived; Whereas Mary Eliza Mahoney served as the director of the Howard Orphanage Asylum for Black children in Kings Park, Long Island, in New York City from 1911 until 1912; Whereas Mary Eliza Mahoney died on January 4, 1926, at the age of 80, after 3 years of battling breast cancer; Whereas Mary Eliza Mahoney’s gravesite is in Woodlawn Cemetery, Everett, Massachusetts, and the headstone on her grave states,  The First Professional Negro Nurse in the U.S.A. ; Whereas Mary Eliza Mahoney was inducted into the American Nurses Association Hall of Fame in 1976; Whereas Mary Eliza Mahoney advanced the nursing profession by fostering high standards of nursing practice and confronting issues affecting professional nurses, such as the shortage of nurses; Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic worsened working conditions for nurses, and Forbes estimated in 2022 that 47 percent of health care workers left or are considering leaving the profession; Whereas, today only 6.3 percent of the registered nurse workforce identify as Black out of the 4,300,000 registered nurses in the country, despite research proving Black nurses are critical for providing Black communities better health care; and Whereas nursing is a critical investment to the delivery of high-quality, cost-effective patient care, and the Nation should invest in and value nursing care: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— (1) honors Mary Eliza Mahoney, the first Black nurse, for an outstanding nursing career, dedication to the United States nursing profession, and exemplary contributions to local and national professional nursing organizations; (2) recognizes Mary Eliza Mahoney as the first professionally trained Black nurse, and honors other Black nurses who practice nursing with distinction; (3) honors and supports the goals and activities of National Nurses Week; (4) promotes further understanding and public awareness of the history of American nurses, particularly Black nurses, who practiced nursing with compassion and devotion and transmitted new scientific knowledge using science-based nursing practice; and (5) advocates for Black, Latina, and other women of color to enter nursing and supports strategies to retain and bring back nurses who are considering leaving or have left the nursing profession.","[{'bioguideId': 'B001224', 'firstName': 'Cori', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 44 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES May 17, 2023 Ms. Lee of California  (for herself and  Ms. Bush ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on the Judiciary CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Urging the establishment of a United States Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation. Whereas the first ship carrying enslaved Africans to what is now known as the United States of America arrived in 1619; Whereas that event more than 400 years ago was significant not only because it ushered in the institution of chattel slavery of African Americans, but also because it facilitated the systematic oppression of all people of color that has been a devastating and insufficiently understood and acknowledged aspect of our Nation’s history over those past 400-plus years, and that has left a legacy of that oppression that haunts our Nation to this day; Whereas the institution of chattel slavery in the United States subjugated African Americans for nearly 250 years, fractured our Nation, and made a mockery of its founding principle that  all men are created equal ; Whereas the signing of the Constitution of the United States failed to end slavery and oppressions against African Americans and other people of color, thus embedding in society the belief in the myth of a hierarchy of human value based on superficial physical characteristics such as skin color and facial features, and resulting in purposeful and persistent racial inequities in education, health care, employment, Social Security and veteran benefits, land ownership, financial assistance, food security, wages, voting rights, and the justice system; Whereas that oppression denied opportunity and mobility to African Americans and other people of color within the United States, resulting in stolen labor worth billions of dollars while ultimately forestalling landmark contributions that African Americans and other people of color would make in science, arts, commerce, and public service; Whereas Reconstruction represented a significant but constrained moment of advances for Black rights as epitomized by the Freedman’s Bureau, which negotiated labor contracts for ex-enslaved people but failed to secure their own land for them; Whereas the brutal overthrow of Reconstruction failed all individuals in the United States by failing to ensure the safety and security of African Americans and by emboldening States and municipalities in both the North and South to enact numerous laws and policies to stymie the socioeconomic mobility and political voice of freed Blacks, thus maintaining their subservience to Whites; Whereas Reconstruction, the civil rights movement, and other efforts to redress the grievances of marginalized people were sabotaged, both intentionally and unintentionally, by those in power, thus rendering the accomplishments of those efforts transitory and unsustainable, and further embedding the racial hierarchy in society; Whereas examples of government actions directed against populations of color (referred to in this resolution as  discriminatory government actions ) include— (1) the creation of the Federal Housing Administration, which adopted specific policies designed to incentivize residential segregation; (2) the enactment of legislation creating the Social Security program, for which most African Americans were purposely rendered ineligible during its first two decades; (3) the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944 (commonly known as the GI Bill of Rights; 58 Stat. 284, chapter 268), which left administration of its programs to the States, thus enabling blatant discrimination against African-American veterans; (4) the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which allowed labor unions to discriminate based on race; (5) subprime lending aimed purposefully at families of color; (6) disenfranchisement of Native Americans, who, until 1924, were denied citizenship on land Native Americans had occupied for millennia; (7) Federal Indian Boarding School Policy during the 19th and 20th centuries, the purpose of which was to  civilize  Native children through methods intended to eradicate Native cultures, traditions, and languages; (8) land policies toward Indian Tribes, such as the allotment policy, which caused the loss of over 90,000,000 acres of Tribal lands, even though two-thirds of that acreage was guaranteed to Indian Tribes by treaties and other Federal laws, and similar unjustified land grabs from Indian Tribes that occurred regionally throughout the late 1800s and into the termination era in the 1950s and 1960s; (9) the involuntary removal of Mexicans and United States citizens of Mexican descent through large-scale discriminatory deportation programs in the 1930s and 1950s; (10) the United States annexation of Puerto Rico, which made Puerto Ricans citizens of the United States without affording them voting rights; (11) racial discrimination against Latino Americans, which has forced Latino Americans to fight continuously for equal access to employment, housing, health care, financial services, and education; (12) the Act entitled  An Act to execute certain treaty stipulations relating to Chinese , approved May 6, 1882 (commonly known as the Chinese Exclusion Act; 22 Stat. 58, chapter 126), which effectively halted immigration from China and barred Chinese immigrants from becoming citizens of the United States, and which was the first instance of xenophobic legislation signed into law specifically targeting a specific group of people based on ethnicity; (13) the treatment of Japanese Americans, despite no evidence of disloyalty, as suspect and traitorous in the very country they helped to build, leading most notably to the mass incarceration of Japanese Americans beginning in 1942; (14) the conspiracy to overthrow the Kingdom of Hawaii and annex the land of the Kingdom of Hawaii, without the consent of or compensation to the Native Hawaiian people of Hawaii; and (15) the United States history of colonialism in the Pacific, which has resulted in economic, health, and educational disparities among other inequities, for people in United States territories, as well as independent nations with which the United States has treaty obligations; Whereas those discriminatory government actions, among other government policies that have had racially disparate impacts, have disproportionately barred African Americans and other people of color from building wealth, thus limiting potential capital and exacerbating the racial wealth gap; Whereas research has shown that the persistent racial wealth gap has had a significant negative impact on other racial disparities, such as the achievement gap, disparities in school dropout rates, income gaps, disparities in home ownership rates, health outcome disparities, and disparities in incarceration rates; Whereas United States civic leaders and foundations have spearheaded critical efforts to advance racial healing, understanding, and transformation within the United States, recognizing that it is in our collective national interest to urgently address the unhealed, entrenched divisions that will severely undermine our democracy if they are allowed to continue to exist; Whereas many of the most far-reaching victories for racial healing in the United States have been greatly enhanced by the involvement, support, and dedication of individuals from any and all racial groups; Whereas, at the same time, much of the progress toward racial healing and racial equity in the United States has been limited or reversed by our failure to address the root cause of racism, the belief in the myth of a hierarchy of human value based on superficial physical characteristics such as skin color and facial features; Whereas the United States institution of slavery, as well as other examples enumerated in this resolution, represents intentional and blatant violations of the most basic right of every individual in the United States to a free and decent life; Whereas the consequences of oppression against people of color have cascaded for centuries, across generations, beyond the era of active enslavement, imperiling for descendants of slaves and other targets of oppression what should have otherwise been the right of every individual in the United States to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; Whereas more than 40 countries have reckoned with historical injustice and its aftermath through forming truth and reconciliation commissions to move toward restorative justice and to return dignity to their citizens; Whereas for three decades there has been a growing movement inside and outside Congress to have the Federal Government develop material remedies for the institution of slavery, including through a Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans described in H.R. 40, 118th Congress, as introduced on January 9, 2023, and S. 40, 118th Congress, as introduced on January 24, 2023; Whereas the formation of a United States Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation does not supplant the formation of a Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans, but rather complements that effort; and Whereas contemporary social science, medical science, and the rapidly expanding use of artificial intelligence and social media reveal the costs and potential threats to our democracy if we continue to allow unhealed, entrenched divisions to be ignored and exploited: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— (1) affirms, more than 400 years after the arrival of the first slave ship to the United States, that the Nation owes a long-overdue debt of remembrance to not only those who lived through the egregious injustices enumerated in this resolution, but also to their descendants; and (2) urges the establishment of a United States Commission on Truth, Racial Healing, and Transformation to properly acknowledge, memorialize, and be a catalyst for progress toward— (A) jettisoning the belief in a hierarchy of human value; (B) embracing our common humanity; and (C) permanently eliminating persistent racial inequities.","[{'bioguideId': 'L000551', 'firstName': 'BARBARA', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 Whereas every United Nations member state has ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity, done at Rio de Janeiro June 5, 1992, with the exception of the United States;   Whereas the United States signed the Convention on Biological Diversity in 1993 but has not ratified the treaty; 
 Whereas the United States, under current domestic law, is already legally compliant with the obligations of the Convention;   Whereas Federal agencies often design their plans to align with Convention on Biological Diversity initiatives; 
 Whereas the absence of the United States from the Convention on Biological Diversity limits the United States to holding the status of an  observer  to deliberations and decision making processes of the Convention on Biodiversity;   Whereas, not being party to the Convention on Biological Diversity, the United States does not have a vote within the convention, which diminishes our voice and influence; 
 Whereas the decisions and rules made by the Convention on Biological Diversity affect both national security and economic interests of the United States in spite of the United States non-party status;   Whereas the United States is one of the world’s largest contributors in international conservation funding and biological diversity expertise; and 
 Whereas we are inextricably interconnected on this planet, and the work of the Convention on Biological Diversity has a direct impact on all Americans: Now, therefore, be it   That it is in the national interest for the Senate to provide its advice and consent for the ratification of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which was signed by the United States in New York on June 4, 1993.","[{'bioguideId': 'S001218', 'firstName': 'Melanie', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 5 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES January 9, 2023 Mr. Tiffany  (for himself,  Mrs. Hinson ,  Mr. Fitzgerald ,  Mr. Reschenthaler ,  Mrs. Lesko ,  Mr. Langworthy ,  Mr. Garbarino ,  Mr. Joyce of Pennsylvania ,  Mr. Wenstrup , and  Mrs. Chavez-DeRemer ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on the Judiciary CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Expressing support for the Nation’s law enforcement agencies and condemning any efforts to defund or dismantle law enforcement agencies. 
 Whereas law enforcement officers protect the American people from criminals who seek to perpetrate violence and harm innocent lives regardless of the political circumstances of the day;   Whereas the brave men and women of the law enforcement community continually summon the courage to fulfill their solemn oath to ensure the safety of our communities and provide peace of mind for our Nation’s citizens; 
 Whereas America’s law enforcement community also seeks to assist the communities they serve through a variety of nontraditional means, including nonarrest pathways that connect individuals with treatment and recovery programs to overcome addiction, and juvenile diversion programs to prevent minors from entering the criminal justice system;   Whereas supporting law enforcement officers with the equipment, training, and funding necessary to serve our communities and keep our streets safe has long been a bipartisan issue; 
 Whereas law enforcement officers willingly face dangerous circumstances and the threat of serious bodily injury or death on a daily basis to ensure the safety of all Americans;   Whereas the National Law Enforcement Memorial and Museum’s 2021 Law Enforcement Officers Fatalities Report detailed that 458 law enforcement officers were killed in the line of duty in 2021, an increase of 55 percent from the previous year, including 62 officers who were killed in firearms-related incidents; 
 Whereas protests have been hijacked by violent extremists seeking to sow discord, damage property, loot businesses, and inflict harm against civilians and law enforcement officers;   Whereas law enforcement officers have been run over, shot, hit with objects, and stabbed attempting to maintain peace and the rule of law; 
 Whereas progressive politicians and interest groups have responded to this violence with calls to defund State and local law enforcement agencies across the Nation;   Whereas defunding or otherwise handcuffing law enforcement officers will make officers less likely to intervene in dangerous situations and will result in law enforcement pulling back from the neighborhoods they are entrusted to protect; 
 Whereas violent crime increases when law enforcement is forced to withdraw from neighborhoods;   Whereas the vilification of the Nation’s law enforcement officers and the embracing of hateful rhetoric against these brave men and women only places them further in harm’s way; 
 Whereas these brave men and women must operate in an environment where their moral and legal authority is constantly being scrutinized, and they undertake the critical yet difficult task of addressing the actions of those affected by addiction, homelessness, and mental illness; and   Whereas efforts to defund police departments will cause irreparable and lasting damage to the Nation: Now, therefore, be it 
 That Congress—   (1) offers its sincere gratitude and appreciation to the Nation’s law enforcement officers who protect and serve our communities;  
 (2) recognizes the great sacrifice our law enforcement officers make to keep the Nation safe; and   (3) rejects the misguided and dangerous efforts to defund and dismantle the Nation’s State and local law enforcement agencies.","[{'bioguideId': 'T000165', 'firstName': 'Thomas', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 54 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES June 23, 2023 Ms. Sherrill  submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Education and the Workforce CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Expressing the sense of Congress that title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 applies to the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA), and the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) should work to prevent discrimination on the basis of sex in its programs and activities. Whereas title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 ( 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ) prohibits sex discrimination in all educational programs and activities that receive Federal assistance, including athletics programs; Whereas title IX was intended to avoid the use of Federal resources to support discriminatory practices and to provide individuals effective protection against such practices; Whereas title IX does not, on its face, confine the list of those liable under the statute to  recipients  of Federal funds, but simply prohibits discrimination  under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance ; Whereas, in the applicable implementing regulations for the Department of Education, the Department of Education requires educational programs to offer students of all sexes equal opportunities to play sports, to allocate athletic scholarships equitably, and to treat athletes of all sexes equally with respect to other benefits and services. (Benefits and services include equipment and supplies, scheduling of games and practice times, travel and daily allowance, locker rooms, practice and competitive facilities, medical and training facilities and services, housing and dining facilities and services, publicity and promotions, support services, and recruitment of student athletes.); Whereas the section 908 of the Education Amendments of 1972 ( 20 U.S.C. 1687 ) broadly defines a  program or activity  that receives Federal funds to mean all of the operations of a list of entities, including colleges and universities, private organizations principally engaged in education, and any other entity established by 2 or more of the listed entities—or what Congress termed the  catch-all  provision; Whereas, in interpreting title IX, Federal courts have correctly held that any entity that exercises controlling authority over a federally funded program is subject to title IX, regardless of whether that entity is itself a recipient of Federal aid; Whereas Federal courts have held that State athletic associations exercise controlling authority over interscholastic athletics programs and are therefore subject to title IX (Among other things, State athletic associations set sports seasons, sponsor State championship tournaments, and set eligibility requirements for student participation in sports. Their membership is comprised primarily of educational institutions that receive Federal funds and must comply with title IX. In order for State athletic associations to control and regulate athletics, member institutions must cede their own ability to control many aspects of their athletics programs to the athletic association.); Whereas Federal courts have correctly reasoned that not subjecting athletic associations to title IX would encourage Federal recipients to empower someone else to promulgate discriminatory policies to avoid title IX liability. Such an interpretation would allow Federal funds to promote sex discrimination and would therefore run afoul of the plain language, meaning, and purpose of title IX; Whereas, like State athletic associations, the NCAA exercises controlling authority over its federally funded member institutions’ athletics programs; Whereas the NCAA is subject to title IX because, pursuant to section 908 of such Act, it is an organization established by two or more colleges or universities that receive Federal funds; Whereas the NCAA is subject to title IX because, pursuant to section 908 of such Act, it is an operation of its federally funded member schools; Whereas, while the Supreme Court ruled in NCAA v. Smith, 525 US 459 (1999), that the NCAA is not subject to title IX by virtue of the dues it receives from its federally funded member schools, the Supreme Court left open the question of whether the NCAA is subject to title IX on alternative grounds, including based on its controlling authority over member schools’ federally funded athletics programs or pursuant to the definition of  program or activity  in section 908 of such Act; Whereas the NCAA is an unincorporated association of approximately 1,200 members, including virtually all public and private universities and 4-year colleges conducting major athletics programs in the United States. Members of the NCAA that receive Federal funds are subject to title IX; Whereas member schools cede control to the NCAA by allowing it to host 90 intercollegiate championship tournaments in 24 sports across 3 divisions (During championship tournaments, the NCAA controls the medical, training, housing, dining, and competition facilities, and dictates the tournament schedule and the publicity and promotion of the teams.); Whereas, because the NCAA is subject to title IX, it must address documented discrimination against women’s teams in the benefits and services provided during championship tournaments so that student athletes who experience sex discrimination during the regular season who are able to seek remedies under title IX have the same remedies when they experience inequitable access to benefits or services during intercollegiate championship tournaments and other barriers to exercising their rights; Whereas, despite being subject to title IX, the NCAA provided inequitable benefits and services to women’s basketball teams in its 2021 Division I Tournaments, including inferior publicity, promotions, equipment, supplies, food, facilities, travel accommodations, and health care protocols and resources; Whereas these disparities are contrary to the letter and spirit of title IX, undermine efforts to ensure gender equity in sports and society writ large, and hold women and girls back from reaching their full potential;  Whereas, on March 25, 2021, the NCAA announced the commissioning of a comprehensive review of gender equity issues in NCAA sports that was completed by the independent law firm Kaplan Hecker & Fink (Kaplan), and the results of their independent review were released in two separate reports on August 2, 2021, and October 25, 2021, which found that gender inequities at the NCAA stem from the structure and systems of the NCAA itself and provided an extensive list of recommended actions the NCAA should take to address these inequities; Whereas more than a year after the release of those reports, the NCAA has made progress on some of Kaplan’s recommendations, but has either not yet begun consideration or declined to implement others, including restructuring NCAA leadership so that the Vice President of Women’s Basketball reports directly to the President; and Whereas the NCAA leadership should make it a top priority to expeditiously and thoroughly consider all recommendations from the Kaplan report to ensure meaningful change: Now, therefore, be it That it is the sense of Congress that the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) is subject to title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 ( 20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. ) and should work to prevent discrimination on the basis of sex in its programs and activities.","[{'bioguideId': 'S001207', 'firstName': 'Mikie', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 55 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES June 30, 2023 Ms. Velázquez  (for herself and  Mr. Espaillat ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Natural Resources CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Recognizing the need for a sustainable, economically viable, and fair debt restructuring plan for the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. 
 Whereas the electrical system of Puerto Rico has been fragile and suffered from a lack of investment for years, since well before Hurricane María destroyed the system in 2017;   Whereas, despite local and Federal efforts to rebuild the electrical grid of Puerto Rico, that electrical grid remains extremely fragile and vulnerable; 
 Whereas, in September 2022, category-1 Hurricane Fiona triggered an island-wide blackout for 1,500,000 customers;   Whereas the population of Puerto Rico, the median household income of which is less than ½ of that of the population of the poorest State, pays among the highest electric rates in the United States; 
 Whereas the transition to renewable energy is key to reducing electric rates in Puerto Rico by eliminating dependence on imported, price-volatile fossil fuels, which constitute up to 60 percent of the budget of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (referred to in this preamble as the  PREPA ), but currently only 3 percent of the energy on the island of Puerto Rico comes from clean sources;   Whereas, between 1974 and 2016, the PREPA made numerous bond issuances pursuant to the Trust Agreement between the Puerto Rico Water Resources Authority and First National City Bank dated January 1, 1974, reaching $8,300,000,000 in outstanding bond debt; 
 Whereas the PREPA is considered to have the largest debt of all public entities in Puerto Rico;   Whereas the retirement system of the PREPA warned that, by April 2023, it would run out of funds to cover the obligations owed to its nearly 12,000 pension holders, and has yet to articulate a plan that ensures future monthly payments for retirees; 
 Whereas, in July 2017, the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico (referred to in this preamble as the  FOMB ) filed a petition pursuant to title III of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act ( 48 U.S.C. 2161 et seq. ), commencing a debt adjustment proceeding for the PREPA;   Whereas, in 2019, the FOMB negotiated an agreement with bondholders that would have resulted in a 10- to 16-percent increase over current electric rates for the following 47 years; 
 Whereas that agreement was ultimately rejected in 2022 by the local legislature and Governor of Puerto Rico, who recognized that the agreement was unaffordable and would impose costs that would undermine the recovery and future economic growth of Puerto Rico;   Whereas, on December 16, 2022, the FOMB filed a new restructuring plan for the PREPA that proposes to reduce almost ½ of the debt of the PREPA and impose a  legacy charge  for consumers who do not benefit from subsidized electric rates; 
 Whereas that plan was amended on February 9, 2023, advocating for the issuance of $5,700,000,000 in bonds, or $13,000,000,000 over 35 years with accrued interest, to partially compensate the creditors of the PREPA, including bondholders;   Whereas the debt service on the new bonds will be paid off via the  legacy charge , which includes both fixed monthly charges and charges that depend on the consumption of electricity; 
 Whereas the estimated  legacy charge  for nonexempt, residential customers would, on average, be around $19 per month;   Whereas the fixed charge would be between $16 and $1,800 per month for commercial and industrial customers; 
 Whereas those charges represent an increase in monthly bills for average residents and small businesses of 12 to 13 percent, on top of rates that are already double the average price for electricity in the continental United States;   Whereas, according to estimates by small business representatives in Puerto Rico, once the increases in energy bills under the current restructuring plan are enforced, nearly 12,000 small businesses would be forced to close, a number 3 times higher than in 2020, a year marked by the onset of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) pandemic; 
 Whereas, according to the 2017 testimony of Andrew Wolfe, an economic expert representing the FOMB, those increases would  eventually contribute to a downward economic spiral that would result in Puerto Rico returning to a path of declining economic activity, which would in turn adversely impact the demand for electricity and in the end lead to another debt service payments crisis for PREPA ;   Whereas the FOMB proposes to raise electric rates in Puerto Rico in spite of a prior economic analysis of the FOMB showing that electric rates in Puerto Rico are unsustainable at current levels; 
 Whereas, in 2022, Congress passed the Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act of 2021 ( Public Law 117–82 ;  48 U.S.C. 2178 ) to impose disclosure requirements on all of the advisers and consultants of the FOMB, closing the loophole in the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act ( 48 U.S.C. 2101 et seq. ) that has disadvantaged the people of Puerto Rico in the debt restructuring process for the island;   Whereas, in 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported that stakeholders hired to consult on the bankruptcy proceedings for Puerto Rico initially failed to disclose connections to companies involved in the PREPA debt restructuring deal, raising the potential for conflicts of interest; 
 Whereas the latest restructuring plan for the PREPA filed by the FOMB does not represent a  durable solution for Puerto Rico’s fiscal and economic crisis [including] permanent, pro-growth fiscal reforms , as instructed by Congress in title VII of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act ( 48 U.S.C. 2241 );   Whereas, in June 2023, the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico suspended the proceedings to evaluate and confirm that latest restructuring plan; and 
 Whereas, on June 23, 2023, the FOMB filed a 2023 Certified Fiscal Plan for the PREPA acknowledging that the latest proposed restructuring plan is not sustainable, and announced that it would present an amended restructuring plan for the PREPA by July 14, 2023: Now, therefore, be it   That Congress— 
 (1) recognizes that the debt adjustment proceeding for the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (referred to in this resolution as the  PREPA ) has been and continues to be of great interest to Puerto Ricans and to Congress;   (2) recognizes that the continuity of unsustainable electric rates will result in— 
 (A) accelerated out-migration from the island of Puerto Rico; and    (B) business closures and unemployment in Puerto Rico; 
 (3) recognizes that the continuity of unsustainable electric rates will further shrink the demand-base and revenues of the PREPA, increasing pressure on the electrical system to cut labor and maintenance costs and inhibiting the reconstruction of the system and the transition to renewable energy;   (4) urges the Financial Oversight and Management Board for Puerto Rico to put forth a restructuring plan for the PREPA that— 
 (A) is economically viable for the PREPA, customers of the PREPA, and PREPA retirees;   (B) allows for the rehabilitation of the electrical system of Puerto Rico; and 
 (C) does not impose additional increases to electric rates for residents, business owners, and users of the electric grid; and   (5) reaffirms the intent of Congress to create  durable solution[s] for Puerto Rico’s fiscal and economic crisis  through the adoption of  permanent, pro-growth fiscal reforms , as stated in title VII of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act ( 48 U.S.C. 2241 ).","[{'bioguideId': 'V000081', 'firstName': 'NYDIA', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 Ms. Schakowsky  (for herself,  Ms. Jayapal ,  Ms. Lee of California ,  Ms. Barragán ,  Ms. Tlaib ,  Mr. Grijalva ,  Mr. Raskin ,  Ms. Escobar ,  Ms. Omar ,  Mr. Espaillat ,  Mr. Trone ,  Mr. Nadler ,  Ms. Brownley ,  Mr. Cohen ,  Mr. Lynch ,  Ms. Norton ,  Ms. Chu ,  Ms. Bush ,  Ms. Crockett ,  Mr. Johnson of Georgia ,  Ms. Williams of Georgia ,  Mr. Khanna ,  Mr. Sarbanes ,  Ms. Jackson Lee ,  Ms. Bonamici ,  Mr. Blumenauer ,  Ms. Castor of Florida ,  Mrs. Trahan ,  Ms. McCollum ,  Mr. Cárdenas ,  Mr. Mullin ,  Mr. Davis of Illinois ,  Ms. Clarke of New York ,  Ms. Titus ,  Ms. Stansbury ,  Ms. Wilson of Florida ,  Ms. Scanlon ,  Ms. Wasserman Schultz ,  Ms. Lee of Pennsylvania ,  Mr. McGovern ,  Ms. Hoyle of Oregon ,  Ms. Tokuda ,  Mr. Frost ,  Ms. Ross ,  Ms. Jacobs ,  Mr. Morelle ,  Mrs. Napolitano ,  Mr. Pocan ,  Ms. Velázquez ,  Mrs. Watson Coleman ,  Ms. Kamlager-Dove ,  Mr. Robert Garcia of California ,  Mr. García of Illinois ,  Ms. Salinas ,  Mrs. Foushee ,  Ms. DeGette ,  Mr. Soto ,  Mrs. Cherfilus-McCormick ,  Ms. Dean of Pennsylvania ,  Mr. Connolly ,  Mr. Vargas ,  Ms. Meng ,  Mr. Thanedar ,  Ms. DeLauro , and  Ms. Pingree ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Energy and Commerce 
 
 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
 Recognizing that the climate crisis disproportionately affects the health, economic opportunity, and fundamental rights of children, expressing the sense of Congress that leadership by the United States is still urgently needed to address the climate crisis, and acknowledging the need of the United States to develop a national, comprehensive, science-based, and just climate recovery plan to phase out fossil fuel emissions, protect and enhance natural carbon sequestration, and put the United States on a path toward stabilizing the climate system. 
 
 
 Whereas a stable climate system at the founding of the United States allowed human life and human civilization to flourish;   Whereas the United States was founded on the deeply rooted principle of securing  the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity ; 
 Whereas the Constitution of the United States protects the fundamental rights to life, liberty, property, and equal protection of the laws;   Whereas a climate system capable of sustaining human life is fundamental to a free and ordered society and preserves other fundamental rights, including the rights to life, liberty, property, personal security, family autonomy, bodily integrity, and the ability to learn, practice, and transmit cultural and religious traditions; 
 Whereas fossil fuel use for energy in the United States has increased since the Industrial Revolution and accelerated such that the fossil fuel-based energy system in the United States has led to carbon dioxide emissions from the United States constituting more than ¼ of cumulative global carbon dioxide emissions;   Whereas the Federal Government sets the energy policy of the United States, which has resulted in an energy system in the United States in which approximately 80 percent of the energy produced in the United States comes from fossil fuels; 
 Whereas the United States is the world’s largest producer of oil and gas, in substantial part through the Federal Government’s leasing of Federal public lands and waters for fossil fuel extraction and through actively promoting, permitting, and subsidizing fossil fuel energy development and consumption;   Whereas there is an overwhelming scientific consensus that human-caused climate change is occurring, that the scale of recent changes across the climate system is unprecedented in a multimillennial context, and that the present accelerated rate of global heating, glacier and ice sheet melting, sea level rise, and ocean acidification is a result of the buildup of atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions, primarily consisting of carbon dioxide emissions, largely from the combustion of fossil fuels; 
 Whereas the accumulation of current atmospheric CO 2  levels to an annual average of 419 parts per million (ppm) in 2022 has caused a dangerous planetary energy imbalance, equivalent to the amount of energy of exploding more than 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day, 365 days per year, across the planet;   Whereas current climate science and real-world observations of the energy imbalance demonstrate that the approximately 1 degree Celsius of warming that has already occurred as a result of human-caused climate change is already dangerous and negatively affecting all aspects of society and the economy of the United States; 
 Whereas the last time atmospheric concentration of CO 2  was around 400 ppm, the seas were up to 70 to 90 feet higher, the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets largely collapsed, and coral reefs suffered a major extinction;   Whereas similar conditions will result if the United States does not drastically reduce CO 2  emissions in addition to naturally sequestering and drawing down excess concentrations of CO 2  already in the atmosphere from cumulative historic emissions this century; 
 Whereas the longer the length of time atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations remain at dangerous levels, the risk of locking in dangerous warming-driven feedback loops and triggering accelerated heating and irreversible catastrophic impacts increases;   Whereas climate change is a threat to national security, as it contributes to and exacerbates global instability and conflict; 
 Whereas today’s children were born into a climate system that is harmful to their health and well-being because of human-caused climate change;   Whereas children are uniquely vulnerable to human-caused climate change because of their developing bodies, higher exposure to air, food, and water relative to their body weight, unique behavior patterns, dependence on caregivers, and longevity on the planet; 
 Whereas human-caused climate change is a public health emergency that adversely and disproportionately impacts the physical health of children through, among other impacts—   (1) increases in extreme weather events, including increases in heavy rainfall, flooding, and hurricanes, that cause disruptive evacuations, school closures, and displacement; 
 (2) increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme heat waves and rising temperatures that cause increased heat exposure and illness, which is a leading cause of death and illness in high school athletes, with nearly 10,000 episodes of heat illness occurring annually;   (3) increases in infant mortality by 25 percent on extremely hot days, with the first 7 days of life representing a period of critical vulnerability; 
 (4) increases in drier conditions and drought, leading to an earlier wildfire season peak, and increased wildfire season length, wildfire frequency, and extent of burned area, exposing children to wildfire smoke that causes substantial eye symptoms, debilitating headaches and nausea, and upper and lower respiratory symptoms that lead to increased rates of asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits;   (5) decreased air quality as children are especially susceptible to air pollution given their developing lungs, higher ventilation rate, and higher levels of physical activity; 
 (6) increases in pollen concentration and a longer pollen season that contributes to allergic rhinitis, where 8.4 percent of children suffer from allergic rhinitis;   (7) altered infectious disease patterns; and 
 (8) increases in food and water insecurity;   Whereas the best scientific information available projects a 15- to 30-foot rise in sea level by 2100 if current trends continue, with ever greater rises and acceleration in subsequent centuries, resulting in increased erosion and the loss of land, causing the loss of communities, homes, infrastructure, agriculture, and coastal ecosystems for affected children, until such time as levels of CO 2  in the atmosphere are dramatically reduced, and steps are taken to cool the upper portion of the ocean; 
 Whereas extreme weather events can negatively impact children’s mental health due to—   (1) family loss or separation; 
 (2) personal injury or injury of loved ones;   (3) damage or loss to personal property and pets; 
 (4) school interruption;   (5) scarcities of food, water, and medicine; 
 (6) public service outages;   (7) displacement, along with the loss of a sense of home and a safe space; 
 (8) loss of nature and cultural activities; and   (9) feelings of uncertainty about the future and a belief that their government is not protecting them from climate change, all of which result in anxiety, trauma, shock, post-traumatic stress disorder, and chronic impacts; 
 Whereas, without immediate steps to address human-caused climate change, the health impacts on children will increase in severity and in terms of the number of children impacted and exposed to dangerous conditions, and will cost the United States billions of dollars per year by the end of the century, with costs growing more expensive as the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increases, and as chronic psychological consequences of climate-related stress increase;   Whereas children will largely shoulder the costs of human-caused climate change, and further increases in the global temperature will saddle children with an enormous, perhaps incalculable, cost burden, undermining the economic security of children and the United States; 
 Whereas, given their vulnerabilities, children are deserving of special consideration and protection with respect to human-caused climate change;   Whereas children are a politically powerless minority without economic or political power to influence climate and energy policy, as they are denied the right to vote until they become 18 years old, and their interests are subjugated to the interests of adults; 
 Whereas children on the front lines of human-caused climate change across the United States and globally have risen up and called upon government leaders around the world to take concrete, science-based, and equitable action to address human-caused climate change and to account for intergenerational inequities to ensure environmental and climate justice for their generation and future generations, including children from vulnerable communities that have borne the brunt of climate change;   Whereas children within environmental justice communities, including communities of color, low-income communities, and Indigenous communities, that have contributed the least to emissions— 
 (1) have long suffered from systemic environmental racism and social and economic injustices;   (2) are more likely to reside in areas with greater exposure to air pollution, experience long-term exposure, and be disproportionately burdened by adverse health or environmental effects, including public health pandemics; 
 (3) are subjected to disproportionate energy burdens; and   (4) have less access to resources needed to cope with climate-related impacts; 
 Whereas global atmospheric CO 2  concentrations must be reduced to below 350 ppm by the end of the century, with further reductions thereafter, in order to restore the planet’s energy balance, stabilize the climate system, and protect the planet’s ice sheets and oceans for posterity;   Whereas current and future adverse public health and other impacts and costs to children and the United States can be significantly mitigated if the United States acts promptly to reduce its emissions from fossil fuels; 
 Whereas numerous experts have concluded that there are multiple technically and economically feasible pathways to place all sectors of the United States economy on an emissions reduction path consistent with returning global atmospheric CO 2  to 350 ppm by 2100;   Whereas producing the energy in the United States with noncarbon-emitting sources will result in energy costs within the range of recent experience, ultimately saving consumers money and stabilizing the cost of energy, while increasing the number of jobs across multiple sectors and the supply chain, and result in many co-benefits, including public health and quality-of-life improvements, the prevention of premature death, infrastructural stability, and biodiversity protection; and 
 Whereas multiple executive departments and agencies with authority delegated by Congress can exercise such authority to prevent and respond to climate change, including the Executive Office of the President, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of the Interior, the Department of State, the Department of Transportation, and the Environmental Protection Agency: Now, therefore, be it     That it is the sense of Congress that— 
 (1) United States leadership is still urgently needed to act to address the human-caused climate crisis that disproportionately affects the health, economic opportunity, and fundamental rights of children in the United States; and   (2) there is a human-caused climate crisis that— 
 (A) has inspired children across the United States to organize and demand immediate government action to protect their fundamental rights from the perils of climate change; and   (B) demands a national, comprehensive, science-based, and just climate recovery plan prepared by the departments and agencies of the executive branch with delegated authority over energy and climate policy, that puts the United States on a trajectory consistent with reducing global atmospheric CO 2  to below 350 parts per million by the year 2100 to uphold children’s fundamental rights.","[{'bioguideId': 'S001145', 'firstName': 'JANICE', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 58 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES July 18, 2023 Mr. Ogles  submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Energy and Commerce CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Calling on the media to engage in responsible and voluntary journalistic practices to deny mass public murderers the attention they desire and minimize any possible  media contagion effect  of irresponsible and sensationalistic reporting practices. 
 Whereas all acts of mass public murder are shameful, cowardly, sickening, and hereby condemned;   Whereas many mass public murderers have openly stated their intention to commit mass murder to gain notoriety, infamy, and affect changes in public policy; 
 Whereas the United States media widely publicizes these murderers’ names, photographs, life stories, motivations, social media posts, and manifestos, giving criminals the notoriety and infamy they desire;   Whereas media coverage of a mass public murderer routinely outweighs the coverage of the victims; 
 Whereas many mass public murderers have researched, studied, and idolized past acts of violence using the sensationalistic coverage provided by many media outlets;   Whereas peer reviewed research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that current media coverage practices concerning mass public shootings demonstrably increase the likelihood of future mass public murders, including— 
 (1) a 2016 study entitled  Mass Shootings and the Media Contagion Effect  published by the American Psychological Association, which suggests a media contagion effect;   (2) a 2017 study entitled  Mass Shootings: The Role of the Media in Promoting Generalized Imitation  published in the American Journal of Public Health, which suggests a generalized imitation effect; and 
 (3) a 2022 study entitled  News coverage and mass shootings in the US  published in the European Economic Review, which suggests a behavioral contagion mechanism;   Whereas research by the Violence Project suggests that mass public shootings are linked to and may be a form of suicide; and 
 Whereas the media has found ways to responsibly and voluntarily limit coverage of other sensitive topics such as suicide, kidnapping, and national security for the common good: Now, therefore, be it   That Congress calls upon the media to voluntarily and responsibly— 
 (1) cover mass public murderers with the similar sensitivity as other forms of suicide completion, with the understanding that a media contagion effect may encourage additional tragedies;   (2) prioritize memorialization and coverage of the names, faces, and life stories of innocent victims killed or injured in a mass public murder; 
 (3) prioritize coverage of the heroism of any law enforcement, first responders, or bystanders that intervene, interrupt the attack, kill or subdue the mass public murderer, or otherwise assist the victims with critical medical assistance;   (4) minimize harm by implementing policies and procedures to deny mass public murderers the infamy, notoriety, and public platform they desire; 
 (5) deny mass public murderers their publicity-related motives and intended goals, such as the promotion of a particular ideology or public policy change;   (6) not name suspected public murderers, except when the alleged assailant is still at large and it would aid in the suspect’s capture; 
 (7) not publish photos of a suspected public murderer, except when the alleged assailant is still at large and it would aid in the suspect’s capture;   (8) avoid utilizing flattering social media profile pictures and other imagery the mass public murderer proudly took of themselves, shared with others, or posted on social media; 
 (9) refrain from naming mass public murderers in headlines and from displaying photos of mass public murderers above the fold of any print copy or at the top of any website’s home page; and   (10) promote data and analysis in mental health, criminology, public safety, self-defense, security, and other relevant professions to support further steps to help eliminate the motivations behind mass public murder and deter future attacks.","[{'bioguideId': 'O000175', 'firstName': 'Andrew', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
 
 July 20, 2023 
 Mr. Moskowitz  (for himself,  Mr. Buchanan ,  Ms. Bonamici ,  Mr. Cohen ,  Mrs. Dingell ,  Mr. Fitzpatrick ,  Mr. Gottheimer ,  Mr. Posey ,  Mr. Raskin ,  Mr. Swalwell ,  Ms. Titus , and  Mr. Van Drew ) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Foreign Affairs , and in addition to the Committee on  Agriculture , for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned 
 
 CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 
 Urging all countries to outlaw the dog and cat meat trade and to enforce existing laws against such trade. 
 
 
 Whereas a bipartisan domestic prohibition on the knowing slaughter, transportation, possession, purchase, or sale of a dog or cat for human consumption was included in section 12515 of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 ( 7 U.S.C. 2160 ), which was enacted on December 20, 2018;   Whereas the dog and cat meat trade occurs throughout the world; 
 Whereas established dog meat markets still exist today;   Whereas non-profit organizations estimate that 30,000,000 dogs and 10,000,000 cats die annually worldwide as a result of the dog and cat meat trade, and those organizations have found that a considerable number of the dogs and cats in this trade are stolen pets still wearing collars when they reach the slaughterhouses, in addition to stray dogs and cats who are captured for slaughter; 
 Whereas there have been reports of abuse, poor living conditions, and cruel slaughtering techniques for dogs and cats farmed for their meat;   Whereas many dogs and cats die during transport to slaughterhouses after days or weeks crammed into small cages on the back of vehicles without food or water, and others suffer illness and injury during transport; 
 Whereas the extreme suffering of dogs and cats at such slaughterhouses and on transportation trucks would breach anti-cruelty laws in the United States and other countries;   Whereas many government officials, civil society advocates, and activists are working to end the dog and cat meat trade on anti-cruelty and public health grounds; 
 Whereas the World Health Organization has linked the dog meat industry to human outbreaks of trichinellosis, cholera, and rabies;   Whereas individuals involved in the dog meat industry are at an increased health risk for zoonotic diseases, such as rabies, which can transfer from dogs to humans through infectious material such as saliva; 
 Whereas the spread of disease may be exacerbated by unsanitary conditions of slaughter and by the sale of dog and cat meat at open-air markets and restaurants; and   Whereas the World Health Organization and the Global Alliance for Rabies Control have both acknowledged the link between the spread of rabies and the dog meat trade which sees large numbers of dogs of unknown disease status moved vast distances: Now, therefore, be it 
 
 That Congress—   (1) calls for an end to the consumption and trade of dog and cat meat on cruelty and public health grounds; 
 (2) urges all countries with a dog or cat meat trade to adopt and enforce laws banning that trade; and   (3) affirms the commitment of the United States to advancing the cause of animal protection and animal welfare, both domestically and around the world.","[{'bioguideId': 'M001217', 'firstName': 'Jared', 'fullName': 'Rep.

Whereas United States citizen Marc Fogel has lived a life of service, teaching history at international schools in Colombia, Malaysia, Oman, Venezuela, and Russia for 35 years; Whereas Marc Fogel taught at the Anglo-American School of Moscow from 2012 to 2021, honorably serving the children of United States diplomats and members of the Armed Forces; Whereas Marc Fogel is known to his family, friends, colleagues, and students as a kind, personable, upbeat, and giving man, a loving father, and a passionate and dedicated teacher; Whereas Marc Fogel has undergone three back surgeries, a spinal fusion, a hip replacement, and two knee surgeries to correct various injuries and health issues, which have left him with chronic back pain and a permanent limp; Whereas Marc Fogel did not wish to use opioids to manage his pain and was instead prescribed medical marijuana for pain management in a manner consistent with the State law of Pennsylvania; Whereas, on August 14, 2021, as he returned to Russia for one final year of teaching before his intended retirement, Marc Fogel was arrested in the Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow for carrying about half an ounce of medical marijuana in his luggage; Whereas Marc Fogel has stated he intended that marijuana solely for personal consumption, and the Government of the Russian Federation has presented no evidence to the contrary; Whereas, on June 16, 2022, a Russian court convicted Marc Fogel of  large-scale drugs smuggling  in a politicized show trial and sentenced him to 14 years in a maximum-security penal colony in Russia; Whereas Russian lawyers informed the family that the typical sentence for Marc Fogel’s offense is five years of probation, and in 2019, the same Russian court sentenced Alexander Grigoriev to eight years in prison for the possession of 1,500 grams of various narcotics; Whereas Marc Fogel’s sentence is vastly disproportionate to the severity of his nonviolent crime, wildly dissimilar to the typical punishments for comparable offenses in Russia, and clearly motivated by ongoing political tensions between Russia and the United States; Whereas, in August 2022, Russian courts denied Marc Fogel’s appeal of his sentence; Whereas the 2021 Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Russia issued by the Department of State reported,  Conditions in prisons and detention centers … were often harsh and life threatening. Overcrowding, abuse by guards and inmates, limited access to health care, food shortages, and inadequate sanitation were common ; Whereas Marc Fogel turns 62 years old in July 2023, and his physical and mental health is rapidly declining due to the stress and harsh conditions of his detention, such that his family fears he will not survive his sentence; and Whereas the Department of State requested Marc Fogel be released from Russian custody on humanitarian grounds, but received no response to that request: Now, therefore, be it That Congress— (1) calls on the Government of the Russian Federation to immediately release Marc Fogel, who has already served more time in prison than his minor and nonviolent crimes can justify; (2) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to respect Marc Fogel’s human rights and to provide full, unfettered, and consistent consular access to Marc Fogel while he remains in detention, in accordance with its international obligations; (3) urges all United States executive branch officials, including President Joseph Biden, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens, to raise the case of Marc Fogel and to press for his immediate release in all interactions with the Government of the Russian Federation; (4) urges the Government of the Russian Federation to desist from issuing outlandishly disproportionate criminal sentences to nonviolent United States citizens; (5) condemns the Government of the Russian Federation’s continued use of detentions and prosecutions of citizens and lawful permanent residents of the United States for political purposes; (6) calls for the immediate release of other citizens and lawful permanent residents of the United States who are wrongfully detained in Russia, such as Paul Whelan, Evan Gershkovich, and Vladimir Kara-Murza; and (7) expresses sympathy for and solidarity with the families of all other citizens and lawful permanent residents of the United States wrongfully detained abroad for the personal hardship experienced as a result of the arbitrary and baseless detention of their loved ones.","[{'bioguideId': 'D000530', 'firstName': 'Christopher', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 IV 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 62 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES August 18, 2023 Mr. Green of Texas  submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Oversight and Accountability CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Expressing the sense of Congress that Congress, as well as people throughout the Nation, should hold an annual commemorative event on or near August 20th to revere, honor, and remember the victims of slavery in the United States as well as to prevent slavery from ever happening again. Whereas this resolution may be cited as the  Original Slavery Remembrance Day Memorialization Resolution ;  Whereas the institution of slavery was a crime against humanity; Whereas the institution of slavery, which was intrinsically inhumane and abhorrent, imposed countless years of suffering on millions of innocent individuals, forever marking our Nation’s past; Whereas any attempt to minimize or rationalize the severity of slavery must be steadfastly rejected; Whereas the abhorrent notion slavery may have been more beneficial than detrimental to those enslaved at any point in time is utterly false and harmful; Whereas the enslaved people, regardless of their age, sex, or status, were subjected to a spectrum of brutalities and inhumanities, from relentless physical and psychological abuse to systemic dehumanization; Whereas the forced labor endured by the enslaved was not only physically strenuous but often involved dangerous tasks, leaving the enslaved vulnerable to accidents, disease, and in many cases, resulting in premature death; Whereas physical punishment, often extreme, was a daily reality for the enslaved, aimed not only at ensuring their submission but also at instilling fear and eroding their self-worth; Whereas the enslaved in the United States lived under constant threat of sexual exploitation, a tool wielded to exert control and further degrade them; Whereas one of the most heart-wrenching aspects of slavery was the forced separation of families; Whereas the system of slavery sinisterly disregarded familial bonds between spouses, siblings, parents and their children by selling them to different enslavers; Whereas the enslaved were stripped of their dignity, identities, cultures, and languages, by enslavers to erase their humanity; Whereas many enslaved individuals died unnamed, unacknowledged, and unappreciated, their lives and contributions lost in the shameful shadows of the institution that dehumanized them; Whereas White supremacy and the repercussions of slavery did not end with the abolition of the institution; Whereas slavery has left an enduring legacy that can still be observed in various forms, including systemic racism and social inequality; Whereas descendants of enslaved individuals continue to be impacted by the lasting effects of slavery, manifesting in disparities in health, education, and wealth accumulation; Whereas it is critical to recognize and address the racial wealth gap, a direct product of slavery and subsequent discriminatory practices, which hampers the ability of African Americans to accumulate wealth comparable to White Americans; Whereas future generations must be vigilant in recognizing and combating signs of racial prejudice, social inequality, as well as all other forms of invidious discrimination, exploitation, and subjugation; Whereas the fight against contemporary progenies of slavery, such as human trafficking, must be relentless to ensure history does not repeat itself; Whereas education and public awareness are essential tools in preventing the resurgence of practices reminiscent of slavery, emphasizing the importance of teaching the history of slavery in a truthful and comprehensive manner; Whereas, in addition to acknowledging the atrocities committed, it is essential to remember and celebrate the strength, resilience, and contributions of the enslaved, as well as their survival and resistance against a system designed to annihilate their identities and self-worth; and Whereas the Nation must commit to a continuous process of reconciliation and healing, acknowledging the historical truth about slavery as well as its enduring impact, while working toward meaningful reparative justice: Now, therefore, be it 1. Short title This resolution may be cited as the  Original Slavery Remembrance Day Memorialization Resolution . 2. Slavery Remembrance Day commemorative events (a) Encouraging people To hold events (1) Architect of the Capitol It is the sense of Congress that Congress, in consultation with the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution, should hold an annual commemorative event on an appropriate day at a location in the United States Capitol Complex to revere, honor, and remember the victims of slavery.  (2) Others Congress encourages all people of good will throughout the Nation to hold an annual commemorative event on an appropriate day to revere, honor, and remember the victims of slavery. (b) Location of events It is the sense of Congress that the annual commemorative event described in this section should be held at a location that can provide an appropriate degree of solemnity and dignity for such an occasion. (c) Dialogue of event It is the sense of Congress that the annual commemorative event described in this section should feature the dialogue recommended in section 3 or a close variation of such dialogue. (d) Purpose The commemorative event described in this section is designed to serve as a memorial to the victims of slavery, to educate the public about the historical reality as well as the lasting impact of slavery, and to inspire continued commitment to not only fight contemporary racial injustice and inequality, but also to continue the struggle for reverence and justice for the enslaved whose lives were sacrificed to make America great. 3. Dialogue (a) Contents The dialogue recommended in this section is as follows: If you can, please join me by standing and placing your right hand over your heart to show heartfelt sorrow for the millions who suffered the horrors of slavery. Over the next few minutes, we will recall various well documented aspects of the experiences of American slaves. At the end of each of these summarized experiences I will say the words  we must : Immediately after I say,  we must  I would like you (each of you) to, in unison, say  always remember . Let’s begin. To prevent the evils of slavery from being repeated we must: Always remember. To commemorate the suffering and the lives lost because of slavery we must: Always remember. For the first 20 enslaved Africans who arrived in the British colonies at Point Comfort near what is now Norfolk Virginia on August 20, 1619, we must: Always remember. For the 12 million humans from all walks of life whose lives were stolen from them when they were kidnaped from Africa we must: Always remember. For the Africans sold into slavery by other Africans we must: Always remember. For the 12 percent of human beings who suffered the deadly middle passage and did not survive the horrific voyage to America we must: Always remember. For the men, women, and children on slave ships, many of whom were kept naked and packed close together, with many shackled and chained we must: Always remember. For enslaved human beings who often worked from sunup to after sundown, 6 to 7 days a week often without food we must: Always remember. For the mothers and fathers who were separated from their children and sold on the auction blocks we must: Always remember. For the freedom fighters such as Nat Turner who fought to free enslaved people; who gave their lives in the fight for freedom and justice we must: Always remember. For the tens of thousands of slaves who risked their lives in search of freedom on the Underground Railroad we must: Always remember. For freedom fighters such as Harriet Tubman, who escaped slavery and dedicated her life to returning to the South no less than 13 times freeing enslaved men women and children, we must: Always remember. For the White liberators like John Brown and President Abraham Lincoln who lived and died combating the horrific institution of slavery we must: Always remember. To commemorate the centuries of suffering, the years of tears shed, the history of hearts broken, the brutality of blood spilled, and the grieving over lives lost because of slavery we must: Always remember. Yet, in the spirit of righteous remembrance imbued with love for our country that hasn’t always loved its brothers and sisters of African ancestry, we have to acknowledge that: In spite of slavery and despite its invidious offsprings: mass lynchings, convict leasing, Black codes, lawful segregation, and institutional racism, African Americans have come a laudably long way. From our arrival on slave ships to our ascension to judgeships,  From surviving the Middle Passage to thriving among the masses, From shackled in chains to creating societal change, From sitting in the back of buses to owning bus companies, From having no house to living in the White House, From painfully picking cotton to proudly picking Presidents, From adult males and females being disrespectfully called boy and girl to being respectfully presented as Mr. President and Madam Vice President. The truth be told, although we have come a long way, we still have a way to go. In closing let us resolve that as we forge forward we will commemorate our past and embrace our destiny, always remembering the hardships people of African heritage have endured in tandem with the victories won in spite of the seemingly invincible challenges emanating from insidious slavery and its invidious progenies! Through it all we must: Always Remember. We must: Always Remember. We must: Always Remember. If you can, I would ask that you participate in a moment of silent solemnity at noon on August 20th wherever you may be.  During this moment, wherever you are, place your right hand over your heart and with a moment of silent solemnity, give thought to the millions who toiled and lost their lives under slavery, and lovingly utter the phrase  I Remember .  . (b) Recitation The dialogue set forth in subsection (a) is to be recited by the leader of the event, except that each instance of  Always remember.  is to be recited by the audience.","[{'bioguideId': 'G000553', 'firstName': 'Al', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 III 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. CON. RES. 9 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES February 7, 2023  Received; referred to the  Committee on the Judiciary CONCURRENT RESOLUTION Denouncing the horrors of socialism. Whereas socialist ideology necessitates a concentration of power that has time and time again collapsed into Communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships; Whereas socialism has repeatedly led to famine and mass murders, and the killing of over 100,000,000 people worldwide; Whereas many of the greatest crimes in history were committed by socialist ideologues, including Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Pol Pot, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un, Daniel Ortega, Hugo Chavez, and Nicolás Maduro; Whereas tens of millions died in the Bolshevik Revolution, at least 10,000,000 people were sent to the gulags in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), and millions more starved in the Terror-Famine (Holodomor) in Ukraine; Whereas between 15,000,000 and 55,000,000 people starved to death in the wake of famine and devastation caused by the Great Leap Forward in China; Whereas the socialist experiment in Cambodia led to the killing fields in which over a million people were gruesomely murdered; Whereas up to 3,500,000 people have starved in North Korea, dividing a land of freedom from a land of destitution; Whereas the Castro regime in Cuba expropriated the land of Cuban farmers and the businesses of Cuban entrepreneurs, stealing their possessions and their livelihoods, and exiling millions with nothing but the clothes on their backs; Whereas the implementation of socialism in Venezuela has turned a once-prosperous nation into a failed State with the world’s highest rate of inflation; Whereas the author of the Declaration of Independence, President Thomas Jefferson, wrote,  To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it. ; Whereas the  Father of the Constitution , President James Madison, wrote that it  is not a just government, nor is property secure under it, where the property which a man has in his personal safety and personal liberty, is violated by arbitrary seizures of one class of citizens for the service of the rest ; and Whereas the United States of America was founded on the belief in the sanctity of the individual, to which the collectivistic system of socialism in all of its forms is fundamentally and necessarily opposed: Now, therefore, be it That Congress denounces socialism in all its forms, and opposes the implementation of socialist policies in the United States of America.  Passed the House of Representatives February 2, 2023. Cheryl L. Johnson, Clerk.","[{'bioguideId': 'S000168', 'firstName': 'Maria', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 January 31, 2023 
 Mr. Casten  (for himself and  Mr. Blumenauer ) submitted the following joint resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on the Judiciary 
 
 JOINT RESOLUTION 
 Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States providing that the Senate is made more representative by adding twelve Senators to be elected nationwide through ranked choice voting, and providing for twelve Electors at-large for President and Vice President, who shall cast their ballots for the respective winners of the national popular vote. 
 
 
 That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States:     —   1. In addition to the Senators from each of the several States, the Senate of the United States shall be composed of twelve Senators at-large, who shall be elected by the People of the United States for six years, and each Senator at-large shall have one vote. Senators at-large shall meet the same age and citizenship requirements as the Senators from each of the several States. 
 2. Senators at-large shall be elected using a nationwide system of ranked choice voting, under which each eligible elector may rank the candidates for office in the order of the elector’s preference. Each elector’s ranking shall hold equal weight in the determination of winning candidates. Seats of the Senators at-large shall be divided equally among the three Classes of Senate seats, so that one-third may be chosen every second year. Except as provided in section four of this article, all candidates shall appear on a single ballot, with the number of winning candidates being equal to the number of seats of Senators at-large then up for election. The first election of Senators at-large shall occur no later than the second regularly scheduled general election for Federal office following the date of the ratification of this article.   3. An eligible elector shall include any United States citizen who is eighteen years of age or older; who has registered to vote by the deadline of the citizen’s State of residence; and who otherwise meets the eligibility requirements, as set by the citizen’s State of residence, for voting in a general election for Federal office. 
 4. Within thirty days of the seat of a Senator at-large becoming vacant, the President shall fill the vacancy by appointing a Senator at-large of the same political party as the departing incumbent. If the seat is not up for election at the next regularly scheduled general election for Federal office, a special election shall be held to determine who shall serve the remainder of the term. Such special election shall coincide with the next regularly scheduled general election for Federal office, and candidates for the seat shall appear on a ballot separate from that of the other seats of Senators at-large then up for election.   5. The election of Senators at-large shall be administered by each of the several States. Each State shall submit all ballots cast within its jurisdiction to such Federal entity as Congress shall by law provide, which shall collect and count the ballots and announce the winners. 
 6. References in this article to the States and the electors thereof shall apply in the same manner to United States territories and the electors thereof and to the District constituting the seat of Government of the United States and the electors thereof.   7. In addition to the Electors for President and Vice President appointed by each of the several States, there shall be twelve Electors at-large, who shall be appointed in such manner as Congress shall by law provide. Electors at-large shall hold the same powers and duties of Electors for President and Vice President, except that Electors at-large shall meet in the District constituting the seat of Government of the United States, where they shall cast their ballots for the presidential and vice-presidential candidates having received the greatest number of votes cast by citizens of the United States. Electors at-large shall be included in determining the whole number of Electors appointed for the purposes of the twelfth article of amendment. 
 8. Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation, including by providing for the procedures under which the nationwide system of ranked choice voting, required by section two, shall be conducted. .","[{'bioguideId': 'C001117', 'firstName': 'Sean', 'fullName': 'Rep.

Whereas the American School Counselor Association has designated the week of February 6, 2023, through February 10, 2023, as  National School Counseling Week ; Whereas school counselors have long advocated that the education system of the United States must provide equitable opportunities for all students; Whereas school counselors have long emphasized the importance of personal and social development in contributing to academic achievement; Whereas school counselors help develop well-rounded students by guiding them through their academic, social-emotional, and career development; Whereas school counselors play a vital role in ensuring that students are college and career ready and aware of financial aid and college opportunities; Whereas school counselors may encourage students to pursue challenging academic courses to prepare them for college majors and careers in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields; Whereas school counselors provide support for students whose family members have been deployed to conflicts overseas; Whereas school counselors help students cope with serious and common challenges of growing up, including peer pressure, bullying, mental health issues, school violence, disciplinary problems, and problems in the home; Whereas school counselors are also instrumental in helping students, teachers, and parents cope with trauma and community and national tragedies; Whereas school counselors are among the few professionals in a school building that are trained in both education and social and emotional development; Whereas despite the important contributions of school counselors to student success, counseling positions are not always protected when local budgets are cut, especially in tough economic times; Whereas the average student-to-counselor ratio in the Nation’s public schools, 408-to-1, is almost double the 250-to-1 ratio recommended by the American School Counselor Association, the National Association for College Admission Counseling, and other organizations; Whereas the celebration of  National School Counseling Week  would increase awareness of the important and necessary role school counselors play in the lives of students in the United States; and Whereas the week of February 6, 2023, through February 10, 2023, would be an appropriate week to designate as  National School Counseling Week : Now, therefore, be it That Congress— (1) honors and recognizes the contributions of school counselors to the success of students in the Nation’s elementary and secondary schools; and  (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe  National School Counseling Week  with appropriate ceremonies and activities that promote awareness of the crucial role school counselors play in preparing students for fulfilling lives as contributing members of society.","[{'bioguideId': 'S001156', 'firstName': 'Linda', 'fullName': 'Rep.

 IA 118th CONGRESS 1st Session H. J. RES. 33 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES February 17, 2023 Mr. Crenshaw  (for himself,  Mr. Smith of Missouri ,  Mr. Zinke , and  Mr. Fitzpatrick ) submitted the following joint resolution; which was referred to the  Committee on Veterans' Affairs , and in addition to the Committee on  Education and the Workforce , for a period to be subsequently determined by the Speaker, in each case for consideration of such provisions as fall within the jurisdiction of the committee concerned JOINT RESOLUTION To acknowledge the courage and sacrifice of veterans of the Vietnam War and formally apologize for the treatment they received upon returning home. 
 Whereas members of the Armed Forces of the United States began serving in an advisory role to the Government of South Vietnam in 1955;   Whereas, in 1965, ground combat units of the Armed Forces of the United States arrived in the Republic of Vietnam to join approximately 23,000 personnel of the Armed Forces who were already present there; 
 Whereas, by 1969, the number of such troops reached a peak of approximately 549,500, including members of the Armed Forces in the region who were supporting the combat operations;   Whereas, on January 27, 1973, the Agreement on Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Viet-Nam (commonly known as the  Paris Peace Accords ) was signed, which required the release of all prisoners of war of the United States held in North Vietnam and the withdrawal of all Armed Forces of the United States from South Vietnam; 
 Whereas, on March 29, 1973, the Armed Forces of the United States completed the withdrawal of combat units and combat support units from South Vietnam;   Whereas, on April 30, 1975, North Vietnamese forces captured Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, effectively placing South Vietnam under Communist control; 
 Whereas more than 58,000 members of the Armed Forces of the United States lost their lives in the Vietnam war, and more than 300,000 members of the Armed Forces of the United States were wounded in Vietnam;   Whereas many thousands of veterans of the Vietnam war were exposed to Agent Orange and other harmful herbicides during the course of their service, carrying home delayed wounds of toxic exposure at the highest rate of any generation of veterans before; 
 Whereas the Vietnam war was an extremely divisive issue back home in the United States as a result of biased and shameful attacks from the media, academia, politicians, and many others;   Whereas some opponents of the war did not limit their opposition to normal political discourse, but engaged in violent protests, including the targeting of Reserve Officers’ Training Corps facilities, recruiting stations, and the bombing of the Army Math Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison;  
 Whereas members of the Armed Forces who served bravely and faithfully for the United States during the Vietnam war were repeatedly targeted with shameful attacks as the result of decisions that were beyond their control; and   Whereas Vietnam Veterans Day will be observed on March 29, 2023, which marks the 50th anniversary of the withdrawal of combat troops from Vietnam: Now, therefore, be it 
 That the United States, acting through Congress—   (1) recognizes the extraordinary sacrifice of veterans of the Vietnam war and commends them for their unwavering and courageous sacrifice to our Nation; 
 (2) urges the President of the United States to formally acknowledge the widespread mistreatment of veterans of the Vietnam war as part of the ongoing Vietnam War Commemoration;   (3) on behalf of the American people, issues the long-overdue formal apology to veterans of the Vietnam war and their families for the mistreatment they endured during and after the war; and 
 (4) expresses urgent support for increased education in our Nation’s schools to better reflect the courage and sacrifice of veterans of the Vietnam war and the lack of support back home.","[{'bioguideId': 'C001120', 'firstName': 'Dan', 'fullName': 'Rep.

Whereas Section 2 of Article IV of the Constitution provides for the rights of a citizen of one State who is temporarily visiting another State, the privileges, and immunities of a citizen of the latter State; Whereas the constitutional right to travel from one State to another is embedded in our jurisprudence and affirmed by the Supreme Court in United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 757 (1996); and Whereas, in Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, (1969), that the right is so important that it is  assertable against private interference as well as governmental action . . . a virtually unconditional, personal right, guaranteed by the Constitution to us all. : Now, therefore, be it That it is the sense of Congress that no State should enact any law that impedes a woman’s ability to engage in interstate travel generally, or to receive services available in that State that are otherwise unavailable in their own State.","[{'bioguideId': 'M000194', 'firstName': 'Nancy', 'fullName': 'Rep.
